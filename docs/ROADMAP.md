# 🗺️ Actor-Web Framework & Agent-Workflow-CLI Roadmap

> **Vision**: Deliver a universal actor-centric development ecosystem where state, side-effects, and all communication are managed **exclusively** through message-passing actors. Create a pure actor web runtime, CLI tooling, and **autonomous agentic workflow system** that demonstrates these principles in practice.

## 🎭 Pure Actor Model Principles

### Core Tenets (Updated from Research)
1. **Message-Only Communication**: No direct state access between actors - all interactions via async message passing
2. **Location Transparency**: Actors can run anywhere (main thread, workers, remote) with identical APIs
3. **Supervision & Fault Tolerance**: Hierarchical "let it crash" philosophy with configurable restart strategies
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All interactions through typed events with proper serialization
5. **Zero Shared State**: Complete isolation between actor boundaries - no singleton registries
6. **Virtual Actor System**: Actors exist logically, instantiated on-demand like Orleans grains
7. **🆕 Autonomous Behavior**: AI-driven actors with memory, planning, and tool usage

### Benefits
- **Isolation**: Actors cannot corrupt each other's state (no shared memory)
- **Scalability**: Seamless distribution across workers/networks (10,000+ messages/sec)
- **Fault Tolerance**: Supervisor strategies for resilience ("let it crash" philosophy)
- **Mental Model**: Clear, consistent programming model (no hidden state)
- **Host-Agnostic**: Deploy anywhere - SPA, MPA, SSR, Edge, Desktop
- **🆕 Intelligence**: Self-improving workflows with persistent memory
- **🆕 True Distribution**: Actors can span processes, machines, and networks transparently
