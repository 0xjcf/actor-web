# 🗺️ Actor-Web Framework & Agent-Workflow-CLI Roadmap

> **Vision**: Deliver a universal actor-centric development ecosystem where state, side-effects, and all communication are managed **exclusively** through message-passing actors. Create a pure actor web runtime and CLI tooling that demonstrates these principles in practice.

## 🎭 Pure Actor Model Principles

### Core Tenets
1. **Message-Only Communication**: No direct state access between actors
2. **Location Transparency**: Actors can run anywhere (main thread, workers, remote)
3. **Supervision & Fault Tolerance**: Hierarchical error handling and recovery
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All interactions through typed events
5. **Zero Shared State**: Complete isolation between actor boundaries

### Benefits
- **Isolation**: Actors cannot corrupt each other's state
- **Scalability**: Seamless distribution across workers/networks
- **Fault Tolerance**: Supervisor strategies for resilience
- **Mental Model**: Clear, consistent programming model
- **Host-Agnostic**: Deploy anywhere - SPA, MPA, SSR, Edge, Desktop
