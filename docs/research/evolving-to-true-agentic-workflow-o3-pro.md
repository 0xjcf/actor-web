Great ‚Äî I‚Äôll begin researching how to establish a true agentic workflow based on your existing framework and CLI. This will focus on bridging from automation to autonomous agent behavior, exploring LLM integration, memory, actor tools, safety, and performance concerns.

I‚Äôll report back with implementation options, prototype patterns, tool recommendations, and a set of proposed design principles for your next roadmap iteration.


# Agentic Workflow Implementation

## Executive Summary

We aim to evolve our developer automation tools from **smart scripted workflows** to **true agentic workflows** that incorporate memory, planning, and adaptive decision-making. Our current foundations ‚Äì the high-performance **Actor-Web** actor system and the **Agent-Workflow CLI** ‚Äì provide a solid base of message-passing, supervision, and developer-centric optimizations. Building on this, we will integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) for planning, introduce persistent memory via vector databases, and design tool actors that allow the agent to perform complex development tasks autonomously. The goal is an AI-driven assistant that can plan and execute multi-step workflows (like validating code, resolving Git issues, running tests, etc.) with minimal human guidance, while respecting safety guardrails and maintaining our existing 10√ó performance advantage in developer operations.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Foundation

Our project already has robust components to build upon:

* **Actor-Web Framework** ‚Äì A fast actor-model system with an **ActorRef** architecture and XState integration, supporting high-throughput message passing (10K+ msgs/sec). Actors have bounded mailboxes and are supervised for fault tolerance, giving us a scalable, reactive core for handling tasks.
* **Agent-Workflow CLI** ‚Äì A rich command-line tool supporting smart validation and Git worktree management. It already includes ‚Äúagent-aware‚Äù commands (like `aw:validate`, `aw:ship`, `aw:sync`) that streamline developer workflows. This CLI provides a great interface for triggering actions; our agent will use these commands as its ‚Äútools.‚Äù
* **Architecture & Patterns** ‚Äì The system is built on asynchronous message passing, with strong **supervision strategies** (actors can restart on failure), and uses observable patterns for monitoring. This ensures reliability and insight into running processes ‚Äì features we will extend for autonomous agent operations.
* **Performance Optimizations** ‚Äì The existing validation and workflow commands are highly optimized (observed \~10√ó faster validation than normal). We must preserve this efficiency even as we layer on planning logic, ensuring that agentic enhancements do not slow down common developer tasks.

This strong foundation lets us focus research on bridging from scripted automation to autonomous agent behavior without reinventing basics like messaging or process management.

## üîç Research Areas

### 1. LLM Integration Strategy

We need a strategy to integrate LLM-based planning and reasoning into our CLI-driven workflows:

**Questions to Research:**

* How can we have an LLM ‚Äúplanner‚Äù invoke existing CLI commands (e.g. running `aw:validate` or `aw:ship`) as tools in a chain-of-thought? We envision a `PlannerActor` that consults an LLM to decide the next action, then dispatches to tool actors for execution.
* Which LLM models offer the best balance of cost and performance for development planning? Options range from powerful cloud APIs (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude) to local models (via Ollama or `llama.cpp`). We must compare accuracy, speed, **privacy**, and cost. For instance, local LLMs keep data in-house and have no ongoing per-call fees, but may require significant hardware or have lower raw capability; cloud models are instantly scalable but send code data to third-party servers (a compliance risk) and incur usage costs. A hybrid approach (local for sensitive tasks, cloud for heavy reasoning) might be ideal. We should also consider routing simpler queries to cheaper/smaller models and only using top-tier models for complex tasks.
* How do we manage token budgets and prevent runaway API costs? Each LLM call can consume hundreds or thousands of tokens, so we need policies for context size and response length. Techniques like **prompt brevity**, setting explicit output length limits, and instructing the model to stay concise can control usage. We might also batch queries or cache results of expensive reasoning steps. Monitoring tokens per task and cost per successful outcome will be important.
* Prompt engineering for developer tasks: We should design prompts that clearly instruct the LLM how to use tools. For example, a prompt might say: *‚ÄúIf the code fails tests, run the validation command and summarize results.‚Äù* Utilizing OpenAI‚Äôs function calling or Anthropic‚Äôs Model Context Protocol could allow the LLM to output a structured command call (JSON) which our system intercepts. We will create templates that provide the LLM with the Git repo state, test outputs, etc., and ask it to propose the next CLI action. Ensuring the prompts guide the model to produce valid commands (and nothing dangerous) is key.
* Fallback strategies for LLM unavailability: The system should handle cases where the LLM API is down or the local model is overloaded. Possible fallbacks include retry with exponential backoff, switching to an alternate provider, or degrading gracefully by using simpler heuristic rules for that cycle. The agent might also recognize it can‚Äôt get guidance and either ask for human help or attempt a safe default action.

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **Design the PlannerActor:** Define how it interacts with the LLM (possibly using an async call pattern). When the PlannerActor receives a goal (e.g. ‚Äúrelease new version‚Äù), it will prompt the LLM for a plan. The LLM‚Äôs plan (a sequence of actions or a tool invocation) will be parsed and dispatched to other actors. We will prototype this with both cloud APIs and a local model to compare.
* [ ] **Benchmark local vs. cloud LLMs:** Set up a small set of planning scenarios (e.g. resolve a merge conflict, run tests and fix failures) and run them with different models (like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude 2, and a local Llama-2 13B). Measure success rate, time, and token usage. Document trade-offs: e.g. local models avoid network latency and give lower latency for some tasks, and guarantee privacy, whereas GPT-4 might solve complex tasks in fewer steps.
* [ ] **Token Budgeting Experiments:** Simulate long-running agent sessions and measure token consumption. Test techniques like summarizing previous dialogue, or limiting history to relevant items, to see how it affects cost and effectiveness. Develop guidelines (like ‚Äúno more than N tokens per plan request‚Äù or using shorter formats).
* [ ] **Prompt Templates for GitOps:** Draft and test prompt templates for common operations ‚Äì e.g. instructing the LLM how to interpret `aw:validate` results. Include examples in the prompt so the model learns the expected format. Evaluate the prompts by feeding in various scenario data and checking if the LLM‚Äôs output is correct and actionable.
* [ ] **Offline/Online Fallback Plan:** Outline how the system behaves if the LLM call fails. For example: if a plan step times out or errors, the PlannerActor could either retry with a simpler prompt, switch to a smaller local model, or log an error and exit gracefully. We will research techniques like those in OpenAI‚Äôs guidance on agent reliability (e.g. guardrails that stop the loop on repeated failures).

### 2. Memory Architecture & Vector Storage

To give the agent context and memory of past events (commits, build results, decisions), we need a memory store optimized for **semantic search** and quick recall:

**Questions to Research:**

* What‚Äôs the optimal memory structure for a development workflow agent? Likely a combination of short-term memory (recent events in an ongoing session) and long-term knowledge (accumulated project history, codebase knowledge, past resolutions). We need to organize information like commit messages, diff summaries, error logs, and user feedback so the agent can retrieve relevant context when planning.
* How to balance query performance vs. storage size? A vector database can store embeddings of text (like commit diffs or conversations) enabling semantic similarity search. We must ensure querying it is fast enough not to bottleneck the agent‚Äôs 10K msg/sec capability. Strategies like using smaller embedding dimensions or indexing techniques (HNSW or IVF) can help. We‚Äôll compare running a local vector store vs. a cloud one in terms of latency for our data sizes.
* What vector embedding strategies suit code and developer data? Code and natural language require good embeddings; we might use OpenAI‚Äôs text-embedding-ada for natural text and a code-specific model for code snippets. Key is that similar problems or error messages map to nearby vectors for easy lookup of past solutions. We should also include workflow metadata (e.g. which files were touched in a task) as part of the embedding context or as metadata fields.
* How will we prune or archive memory over long projects? An agent on a project for months could accumulate thousands of events. We need policies to discard or compress old memory: e.g. keep all events from last week, but summarize older events into high-level notes. Also consider storing only indices for old code states (or relying on Git history as storage). The memory system might periodically **summarize and compact** past logs to save space.

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **Compare Vector Database Options:** Evaluate at least three solutions ‚Äì e.g. **SQLite with VSS extension**, **ChromaDB**, and **Pinecone** ‚Äì for storing embeddings of our data. SQLite+VSS offers a simple, file-based approach that keeps data local (great for privacy and portability), but might not scale to millions of embeddings or high concurrent load. ChromaDB is an open-source vector DB designed for AI embeddings, likely easier to scale for large data and offering a simple SDK, though it requires running a separate service and is still a young project. Pinecone is a managed cloud service with strong performance and scalability (and features like automatic indexing, monitoring), but incurs costs and externalizes data (less control), and may have query rate limits on certain tiers. We will install SQLite-VSS and Chroma locally to benchmark insertion and query time on a sample of, say, 10k embeddings, and also test Pinecone via API.
* [ ] **Design Memory Schema:** Define what constitutes a memory ‚Äúitem.‚Äù Likely candidates: a git commit (with metadata like author, timestamp, message), a validation run (with test results), an interaction (agent tried X and outcome Y). Each item will have text for embedding (e.g. commit diff or error message), plus metadata (tags like ‚Äúcommit‚Äù or ‚Äútest-failure‚Äù and links to related IDs). This schema will support queries like ‚Äúfind similar errors‚Äù or ‚Äúrecall last time we edited file X.‚Äù We will design this in a way that episodic memories (time-ordered events) can be retrieved by recency or similarity.
* [ ] **Implement Episodic vs Semantic Memory:** Plan how the agent uses memory. Possibly maintain a **short-term buffer** (last N interactions) in context, and use the **vector store** as long-term memory. When the agent faces a new problem, it queries the vector store for similar past events. We will prototype a simple retrieval: given a situation (e.g. ‚Äútest failed with error E‚Äù), embed that description and find the top 5 similar past events. Then feed those into the LLM prompt. Measure if this improves the LLM‚Äôs plan quality.
* [ ] **Memory Pruning Strategy:** Simulate a long project with many events. Test a strategy where after X events, we summarize older ones. For example, after a task is completed, the agent could store a summary like ‚ÄúOn Aug 1, agent resolved a merge conflict in module Y by doing Z.‚Äù These summaries (which are shorter text) could replace the fine-grained data in vector DB for older episodes. Research how other autonomous agents handle memory growth ‚Äì e.g. AutoGPT had issues with growing memory and often resorted to summarization. We should document rules for what to keep vs compress (perhaps keep all final outcomes and key decisions, drop low-level logs beyond 1 week).
* [ ] **Benchmark Memory Queries:** Ensure that our memory lookup (embedding + similarity search) is efficient. Using local vector indices (FAISS-based) should allow millisecond-level searches over tens of thousands of vectors. We will measure the end-to-end time for a memory query and aim to keep it under, say, 50ms for a moderate memory size. If it‚Äôs slower, consider improving by filtering by metadata (e.g. restrict search to same project or file) which many vector DBs support for hybrid filtering.

### 3. Tool Actor Protocol Design

To enable the agent to perform actions, we will wrap existing CLI operations (Git commands, validation routines, etc.) into **Tool Actors** with a standardized protocol:

**Questions to Research:**

* How do we encapsulate CLI commands like those in `GitOperations` or `ValidationService` as actors that can be invoked by the Planner? We need each tool to accept a clearly defined message (with parameters) and return a result (success/failure and any output). Designing a consistent message schema (potentially JSON-based) will be crucial so that the LLM can easily request actions in a structured way. For example, a `GitActor` could accept a message `{ type: "git.merge", branch: "feature123" }` and perform the merge, then reply with the result or error.
* What standard message schemas or interface do we use so that adding new tools is easy and interoperable? We might define an interface like: `ToolRequest { toolName, params }` and `ToolResponse { toolName, result, error? }`. These could align with how we describe tools to the LLM (similar to OpenAI function calling JSON schema). Using JSON Schema definitions for each tool‚Äôs input/output could ensure the LLM knows how to format requests.
* How do we handle errors from tools and retry logic? If a tool actor encounters an error (e.g. `git merge` conflict, or `tests failed` in validation), the agent should have a strategy: possibly the PlannerActor, upon receiving a failure response, can decide a new plan (like try another approach or ask for human help). We need a robust error propagation mechanism ‚Äì e.g. tool actors never just crash; they send back a message with an error field, which the Planner can interpret. Automatic retries could be built in for transient failures (with backoff), but for logic errors (like "tests failed"), the agent should handle it by adjusting the plan, not blind retry.
* Resource management concerns: Each tool might involve external resources (files, processes). E.g. a **TestRunnerActor** might spawn a process to run tests; a **GitActor** will touch the working directory. We must ensure tools don‚Äôt conflict (maybe serialize access to the repo) and that resources (file handles, subprocesses) are cleaned up. The actor model helps since each tool actor can be single-threaded and isolated, but we should implement timeouts or supervision in case a tool hangs.
* Discovery and dynamic registration: How can the system know what tools are available to the agent? If we add a new tool actor plugin, the Planner should be able to use it. We might maintain a registry that maps tool names to actor addresses. At startup, all Tool Actors could register themselves with a Supervisor or Directory actor. The LLM prompt can then be built from this registry (listing available tools and their usage). Research how frameworks like LangChain or Anthropic‚Äôs MCP handle tool discovery ‚Äì e.g. MCP has servers advertising their available tools and schemas. We could implement something similar where the PlannerActor queries a list of tools on initialization.

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **Wrap CLI Commands into Actors:** Implement prototypes for GitActor (for version control tasks: clone, commit, merge, push), ValidationActor (to run our `aw:validate` logic), and TestActor (to run test suites). Each should have a clear message schema, e.g. `GitRequest { action: "merge", args: {...} }`. We will likely mirror the function signatures we already have in the CLI, but adapt them to asynchronous message handling.
* [ ] **Define JSON Schemas for Tools:** For each tool actor, write a JSON schema (or TypeScript interface) representing its input. For example, a **MergeTool** might require a `targetBranch` and optional `sourceBranch`. This schema will serve dual purpose: validate incoming messages (ensuring the Planner sends correct params) and as documentation for the LLM (so it knows how to call the tool). We can take inspiration from LangChain‚Äôs tool definitions where each tool has a name, description, and input schema.
* [ ] **Integrate with Planner LLM Calls:** Extend our prompt generation code to include tool schemas. If using OpenAI, we can supply the functions parameter with these definitions so the LLM can output a JSON tool call. If using Anthropic‚Äôs approach, provide instructions like *‚ÄúFormat tool usage as JSON: {tool: X, args: {...}}‚Äù*. Build a small test where the LLM is asked to do a simple task (e.g. create a new branch and list files), and verify it produces a tool invocation that our system can parse and execute.
* [ ] **Error Handling & Retries:** Implement a strategy where the Tool Actor, on failure, includes an error message in its response. Then the PlannerActor (or LLM) can decide to retry or not. For example, if a `git push` fails due to no auth, that‚Äôs probably fatal and we should abort or ask for credentials (human-in-loop). If a test fails, that‚Äôs not a ‚Äúfailure of the tool‚Äù per se, but a signal for the agent to take corrective action. We will categorize errors into retryable (transient network issues, etc.), non-retryable (invalid args), and logical (task-specific outcomes like test failures), and define how each is handled (retry automatically, abort, or plan adjustment).
* [ ] **Tool Lifecycle & Supervision:** Use our actor supervision to manage tools. For instance, if a tool actor crashes (unexpected exception), the supervisor can restart it, but the agent should be notified that its last action didn‚Äôt complete. Also, ensure that only one instance of certain tools runs at a time if they share resources (perhaps by design, we have a single GitActor singleton). We‚Äôll test scenarios like triggering two git operations concurrently and ensure the actor queues them safely.
* [ ] **Study Orchestration Patterns:** Research how CI systems orchestrate tools ‚Äì e.g. GitHub Actions uses a workflow YAML where each step either runs or halts on failure. Jenkins pipelines allow retry blocks and post-failure steps. From these, extract ideas like *sequential vs parallel execution*, *conditional execution on success/failure*, etc., which our planner agent might need to incorporate in its strategy (the LLM could be guided to plan steps conditionally). Document any useful patterns (like ‚Äúalways run cleanup step at end‚Äù similar to finally blocks).

### 4. Safety & Governance Framework

Autonomous agents need safeguards so they don‚Äôt perform destructive actions or violate policies. We will extend our existing supervision and add governance rules for the agent‚Äôs actions:

**Questions to Research:**

* How to prevent the agent from making destructive Git operations or other harmful changes? We should enforce allow/deny lists for tool usage. For example, perhaps **never allow** `git push --force` to main, or deletion of production data. The tool actors themselves can have built-in checks. We might implement confirmations for certain high-risk actions: e.g. if an agent tries a `delete_branch` tool on main, the system could pause and request human approval. Anthropic‚Äôs Model Context Protocol design suggests having the host layer require consent for dangerous tools (like a `delete_file` request). We will incorporate a similar confirmation step.
* How can we extend supervision strategies for agents? Our actor model already restarts crashed processes ‚Äì for agents, we need *behavior* supervision too. For example, detect if an agent is stuck in a loop (repeating the same actions without progress) and intervene. This could be a watchdog that monitors the sequence of tool calls and stops the agent if it exceeds a certain number of iterations or time. OpenAI and others recommend having **stop conditions** to maintain control (like max steps or a timeout per task). We‚Äôll implement these to avoid runaway agents.
* Rate limiting and budget enforcement: The system should enforce limits on API usage (to control cost) and perhaps on performing heavy operations (to avoid overloading systems). We might say an agent can make at most N concurrent tool calls, or only M LLM calls per minute. If limits are hit, the agent could pause or escalate to human. This ensures a bug in the agent logic doesn‚Äôt, for example, spam 1000 API calls in a minute or continuously run expensive operations.
* Human-in-the-loop patterns: Identify which operations are sensitive enough to need manual approval. Merging to the main branch, releasing a package, or deleting resources are candidates. We can design the agent to request confirmation via the CLI UI (e.g. flashing a prompt ‚ÄúApprove agent‚Äôs action Y/N‚Äù). Another pattern is **review mode**, where the agent prepares a change (like a Git patch) but a human must approve before it‚Äôs applied. We will research guidelines from OpenAI/Anthropic on human oversight ‚Äì Anthropic emphasizes sandboxing and extensive testing for agents, and OpenAI‚Äôs tools include a moderation step for safety. In practice, a staging environment for agent actions might be wise: e.g. the agent pushes to a staging repo, and only a human merges to production.
* Audit trails and compliance: We should log every action the agent takes (every tool invocation with timestamps and parameters) to a secure audit log. This way, if something goes wrong, we have a full record. It also helps in debugging the agent‚Äôs decisions later. For enterprise use, these logs might need to be stored centrally and protected, as they could be needed for compliance reviews. We‚Äôll need to ensure no sensitive info is inadvertently logged (or if so, logs are access-controlled).

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **Extend Supervisor for Agent**: Modify our Supervisor actors to monitor agent behavior, not just crashes. Implement a mechanism to terminate or reset an agent that exceeds certain thresholds (time, iterations, or error count). For example, an agent that has failed 3 attempts to fix tests should stop and ask for help. Develop a configuration for these thresholds that can be tuned per environment (maybe more lenient in test, stricter in prod).
* [ ] **Command Allow/Deny List**: Go through our toolset and label each as Safe, Caution, or Forbidden for autonomous use. E.g., `git fetch` (safe), `git push` (caution), `git push --force` (forbidden). Enforce this in the Tool Actors ‚Äì if forbidden, they refuse and prompt that this action requires human intervention. For caution items, implement the confirmation flow: the tool actor can send a message to a UI actor or CLI prompt waiting for approval. We will test this flow manually to ensure an agent pauses for input.
* [ ] **Integrate OpenAI/Anthropic Safety Tools**: If using cloud LLMs, leverage content filters to ensure the agent doesn‚Äôt produce unsafe outputs. But more relevant, use their guidelines: e.g., OpenAI‚Äôs agent guide suggests using guardrails on tool usage. We‚Äôll adapt those ideas (like maybe wrapping the LLM output parser to catch if it tries to call an unapproved tool or injects a shell command that‚Äôs not allowed). Essentially, the plan executor should **validate each proposed action** against our policy before running it.
* [ ] **Approval Workflow Prototype**: Create a scenario where the agent tries a sensitive action (like merging to `main`). Implement a simple ‚ÄúAre you sure? (yes/no)‚Äù prompt in the CLI. The agent should halt until approval is given or denied. This might involve pausing the PlannerActor‚Äôs loop. Test that denying properly stops the agent from proceeding with that action.
* [ ] **Logging and Audit**: Enhance our logging to include agent actions. Each tool actor invocation can emit an event like `AgentActionLog { tool: X, params, result }` which gets recorded (perhaps by a dedicated LoggingActor writing to a file or database). Ensure that these logs are timestamped and include enough context (which agent, which task). We will also create a summary command (like `aw:history`) that prints recent agent actions for user transparency.
* [ ] **Explore External Guidelines**: Compile a brief report of best practices from sources like OpenAI‚Äôs ‚ÄúPractical guide to agents‚Äù and Anthropic‚Äôs safety principles. Focus on any concrete mechanisms (for example, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude has a principle of refusing certain requests; we mirror that by not letting our agent do operations outside its scope). Make sure our design addresses each major risk identified (e.g. self-modifying code, infinite loops, data leaks).

### 5. Performance & Scalability

One challenge is ensuring that adding an ‚Äúagentic layer‚Äù (LLM calls, memory lookups, etc.) doesn‚Äôt degrade the performance and scalability of our system which currently handles high throughput. We will analyze and optimize for minimal overhead:

**Questions to Research:**

* Where are the potential bottlenecks when an agent is planning actions? The current CLI can validate 10K files or messages per second in pure automation. If we introduce an LLM call in the loop, that single call could take 1-5 seconds, which is orders of magnitude slower. While the agent won‚Äôt call the LLM for every low-level message, it will for high-level planning. We need strategies to mitigate this, such as doing as much work in parallel as possible or limiting how often planning is invoked. Perhaps the agent can plan an entire sequence in one LLM call rather than calling for each step. Caching or reuse of plans for repeated tasks could also help ‚Äì e.g. if the agent has fixed similar errors before, it might directly apply known fixes without a full LLM consult every time.
* Memory usage for concurrent agents: If multiple agent instances run in parallel (say different projects or different tasks), each might load LLM models or store context. We should measure memory consumption of our PlannerActor (especially if using a local model in memory). If using cloud APIs, memory isn‚Äôt as big an issue, but token caches and embedding stores are. A vector DB with hundreds of thousands of embeddings might consume gigabytes of RAM/disk ‚Äì we need to size this properly and consider sharding or offloading if needed.
* CPU/IO overhead: LLM planning is CPU-intensive (for local inference) or network-intensive (for API calls). We should ensure our message-passing threads remain responsive. Possibly run the LLM calls in a separate thread pool or service so as not to block the main actor event loop. Also, heavy Git operations (like scanning a repository) are I/O intensive; if the agent triggers many of those in succession, it could saturate disk or CPU. We need to profile a worst-case agent scenario (for example, agent decides to run tests 10 times in a loop) and see how the system handles it.
* Scaling to large repos and teams: Consider a repository with thousands of files or a team running multiple agents on different branches. The design should handle large data (embedding many files, long commit histories in memory) and avoid single points of contention (for example, if two agents both try to use the GitActor, one might need to queue). We might need to allow read-only operations to happen in parallel but queue write operations. Also, if many users run agents concurrently, consider whether we spawn one PlannerActor per user or one global ‚Äì and how they might share resources.
* Caching strategies: We already have smart validation caching. We can extend caching to agent work: e.g., if the agent asks ‚ÄúHave I seen this test failure before?‚Äù, the memory DB essentially is a cache of past issues. We could also cache LLM outputs for identical prompts (though exact repeats may be rare). Another idea: maintain a cache of recent tool results so if the agent contemplates the same action twice it doesn‚Äôt duplicate effort. Essentially, avoid doing the same expensive operation repeatedly in a short span.

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **Benchmark Agentic Overhead:** Set up a scenario to measure baseline vs agent mode. For example, measure how long a straightforward task takes manually (just CLI commands) vs letting the agent handle it. Include an LLM call and memory lookup in the agent path. This will quantify the ‚Äúagent tax.‚Äù If the overhead is too high (e.g., an agent taking 5√ó longer than direct), identify the biggest contributors (likely LLM latency). We may explore partially reducing LLM usage (maybe for simple tasks, the agent could have some built-in logic).
* [ ] **Profile Resource Use:** Run a long agent session with debug tools to profile CPU, memory, and I/O. Specifically measure memory usage of the vector store as it grows, and the memory overhead of any loaded models. Check that our system doesn‚Äôt leak memory across agent runs (each completed task should allow memory to be reclaimed aside from long-term storage).
* [ ] **Concurrent Agent Test:** Simulate multiple agents by running tasks in parallel (if possible, in separate threads or processes to mimic multi-user usage). Observe if any contention arises (e.g., lock contention in the Git tool, or database locks in SQLite). If issues are found, implement locking or adjust actor concurrency (maybe a single GitActor with internal queue is already providing the necessary serialization). Ensure that high message throughput is still maintained for non-agent parts of the system ‚Äì the agent shouldn‚Äôt starve other actors.
* [ ] **Optimize Hot Paths:** Identify any frequently called sections in the planning loop that could become hot spots. For instance, embedding generation for memory queries ‚Äì if we do this every loop, maybe cache embeddings for recent or frequent queries. Another example: the agent might repeatedly request the status of the repository; we could cache the last known status for short periods. Use profiling data to pinpoint functions to optimize or calls to eliminate. We might leverage our existing performance optimizations (like the efficient validation logic) by exposing them as tools rather than having the LLM re-compute things.
* [ ] **Maintain 10K msg/sec**: While an agent‚Äôs single workflow likely won‚Äôt hit that message rate due to external calls, the underlying actor system should still handle bursts. Design tests where many messages (e.g. file change events) are sent while an agent is active, to ensure the system can interleave agent work with other messages. If performance issues arise, consider strategies like back-pressure (maybe slow down external events while agent busy) or distributing agents across multiple nodes if necessary.
* [ ] **Scaling Strategy**: If we needed to support a much larger scale (monorepos, dozens of agents), outline how we would scale out. This could include running the vector database as a separate service (with sharding options), possibly running the LLM planner on a dedicated machine or GPU, etc. Document any potential need for horizontal scaling and how our architecture could accommodate it (for example, multiple PlannerActors behind a queue system, or one agent per CPU core, etc.).

### 6. User Experience & Interaction Design

To make autonomous agents usable and trustworthy to developers, we must carefully design the CLI user experience and interaction:

**Questions to Research:**

* How will users invoke and control autonomous agents via our CLI? We already have `aw:status` showing a dashboard of ongoing operations. We should extend this to display the **agent‚Äôs state** ‚Äì what goal it‚Äôs working on, current step, any pending questions for the user. Possibly introduce new commands like `aw agent run <goal>` to start an agent, `aw agent pause` or `aw agent stop` to interrupt it, and `aw agent status` for a detailed view of its progress. The UX should make it clear that an agent is running autonomously, and allow the user to intervene if needed.
* How to visualize progress and provide feedback for long-running tasks? We might use a live updating status (e.g., a spinner or progress bar) in the terminal. If the agent is doing multi-step work (e.g., ‚ÄúRunning tests‚Ä¶ Fixing bug‚Ä¶ Committing fix‚Ä¶‚Äù), printing each step with timestamps can reassure the user that it‚Äôs making progress. For a richer experience, we could integrate with a text-based UI (like curses or even a simple web dashboard) to show, for example, a tree of tasks/subtasks, or logs in real time.
* Interaction for interruption and overrides: If the user notices the agent going down a wrong path, they should be able to stop it quickly (Ctrl+C or a specific command). We should handle a manual stop gracefully, ensuring any partial changes are rolled back if possible (e.g., if it was in the middle of a series of Git operations, perhaps abort the sequence). We also might allow the user to give feedback mid-run. For example, the agent might ask, ‚ÄúTests are failing, should I attempt to fix the test or revert the commit?‚Äù ‚Äì the user could then respond via the CLI. Designing a smooth prompt/response mechanism in a CLI (without a full chat UI) is challenging but perhaps we can borrow patterns from interactive CLI wizards (like how `npm init` asks questions).
* Learning from user corrections: When a user intervenes ‚Äì say the agent made a wrong code change and the user fixes it manually ‚Äì how does the agent incorporate that? In the short term, the agent could recognize new commits or changes done outside of it as new context (perhaps diff the user‚Äôs change to understand what was wrong). In the long term, we might update the agent‚Äôs memory or even fine-tune the model based on these corrections. We should research if any frameworks support feedback loops where the agent improves over time by logging failures and human fixes. A simpler approach is to log these instances and periodically review them to adjust prompts or add new rules (‚Äúif tests fail in module X, do Y because user did Y last time‚Äù).
* UX patterns from existing systems: Look at tools like GitHub‚Äôs Copilot or ChatGPT for code ‚Äì how do they present autonomous suggestions and how does the user accept or reject them? Also, consider how continuous integration systems report progress (they often show logs live). Our CLI could mimic those patterns, ensuring familiarity for developers.

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **Extend `aw:status` Dashboard:** Design what information about agents to show. Possibly list active agents with their goal and status (e.g., ‚ÄúAgent1: Releasing v1.2 ‚Äì currently running tests‚Äù). Also show if any agent is paused waiting for user input. Implement a prototype of this in the CLI, ensuring it updates appropriately as agent state changes (we might use an event bus or have agents push status updates to a StatusActor).
* [ ] **New CLI Commands for Agents:** Implement `aw agent start <goal>` which creates a PlannerActor with the given goal. Consider flags like `--dry-run` (agent will only simulate actions and not perform destructive changes) for cautious users. Also `aw agent stop <id>` to terminate an agent gracefully. Make sure each agent has an identifier for management. Possibly `aw agent list` to show all running or recent agents.
* [ ] **Progress Visualization:** Work on how to output agent activity. At minimum, log each tool invocation and result to the console with clear formatting (maybe prefixes like `[Agent]` or different colors). If possible, incorporate a progress bar for known-length tasks (though many tasks are dynamic). For long outputs (like a long test output), we might collapse it or summarize it to not overwhelm the user ‚Äì or direct them to an output file. Gather feedback from a few users on what information they care about during agent execution and tailor the output.
* [ ] **Interactive Prompts:** Prototype a scenario where the agent asks a question. For example, agent reaches a decision point and sends a message ‚ÄúAwaiting approval to deploy to production (yes/no)‚Äù. The CLI should detect this and present it to the user, then capture input and feed it back to the agent. We will likely implement this by having the agent emit a special event or write to STDOUT and pause until an answer is provided. Handling this asynchronously is tricky if the CLI is non-interactive, but we can document that certain commands require user presence. Ensure that if the user doesn‚Äôt respond (or is AFK), the agent eventually times out or aborts safely.
* [ ] **User Feedback Logging:** Each time a user stops an agent or overrides it, log that event to memory. Later, analyze these logs to find common patterns where the agent needed help. This will inform improvements (maybe the prompt was insufficient for those cases, or a new safety rule is needed). As a stretch goal, the agent could automatically incorporate the feedback: for instance, if a user corrects a code change, the agent‚Äôs memory could store the corrected diff as ‚Äúpreferred solution for X type of error.‚Äù In research, we might simulate this by intentionally making the agent take a suboptimal action and then feeding the correction as memory to see if next time it chooses differently.
* [ ] **Survey Existing Agent UX:** Look up case studies or demos of autonomous coding agents. Note how they present themselves (some have a ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù stream showing what the AI is thinking). We might not show raw chain-of-thought to users (could be too verbose or confusing), but maybe a condensed version (‚ÄúAgent: I plan to do A, then B‚Äù). Possibly allow a verbose mode for those who want to see internal reasoning. Ensure our design builds user trust ‚Äì by being transparent enough about actions, but not needing the user to babysit every step.

### 7. Privacy & Security

Since our agent will handle source code, commit history, and possibly sensitive project information, we must enforce privacy and security measures from the start:

**Questions to Research:**

* How do we handle data that goes to LLMs? If using a cloud LLM, code and context we send might contain proprietary information. Many companies ban sending certain code to external services. Strategies include anonymization (perhaps not feasible for code), limiting what is sent (e.g., don‚Äôt include full source, just summaries or error messages), or using on-premises models for sensitive parts. We might also explore hosting an open-source LLM in an air-gapped environment for maximum privacy. We should enumerate what data the agent will routinely send (commit diffs, stack traces, etc.) and assess the sensitivity.
* Local vs cloud execution implications: If the user opts for a local model, everything stays on their machine, which is good for privacy but then security depends on their environment (we should ensure the model runs in a secure way, not exposing an API to the network, for example). Cloud models have their own security promises, but we have to trust the provider. Possibly provide settings to let users choose which model (and thus where data goes) per organization policy.
* Encryption and secure storage: The vector memory may store sensitive info from code or internal discussions. If this is on disk (SQLite or Chroma files), we should consider encrypting it at rest, especially if on a shared machine. Using OS-level encryption or an encrypted SQLite database could be options. Additionally, any config files storing API keys or tokens for the agent should be encrypted or kept secure (perhaps integrate with a secrets manager).
* Compliance with enterprise policies: If targeting enterprise, ensure our design can meet requirements like SOC2, GDPR (e.g., ability to delete data on request from memory), and that we properly handle PII or secrets. For instance, the agent should be careful not to log secrets or include them in prompts. Possibly incorporate a scanner that removes or masks things like passwords or keys from being put into the LLM prompt.
* Auditing and access control: Who can run an agent and what can it access? We might need to implement permission levels ‚Äì e.g., only certain roles can run an agent that can push to production. Or an API token required to trigger certain operations. Since it‚Äôs a CLI dev tool, this might be less of an issue (it‚Äôs the developer themselves usually), but in a team setting one might accidentally run an agent on the wrong project. Perhaps include confirmation like ‚ÄúYou are about to let the agent push to the company repo, continue?‚Äù if not on a personal fork.

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **Data Flow Analysis:** Map out all points where data leaves the local environment. For each LLM call (if cloud), identify the data content and mark if sensitive. Also consider the vector DB if using a hosted one (Pinecone) ‚Äì that means embeddings (which could indirectly reveal code) are stored on their cloud. Document these flows and determine risk level. This will guide whether certain features must default to off for sensitive projects.
* [ ] **Local Model Evaluation:** Investigate running a capable local model (like Llama-2 70B or Code LLMs) to avoid cloud usage. What hardware is needed, and can we integrate it (perhaps via Ollama or similar)? We might find that smaller fine-tuned models can handle certain planning tasks on CPU/GPU locally. If viable, we will prototype an option for ‚Äúoffline mode‚Äù where no external calls are made ‚Äì using only local LLM and local memory. This mode would be important for highly secure environments.
* [ ] **Secure Storage:** If using SQLite for memory, test using SQLite‚Äôs encryption extension (SQLCipher) to encrypt the DB file. For Chroma or others, see if they support encryption or if we can place them on encrypted disk volumes. Also plan for safe handling of vector data backups (if any). Make sure any temporary files the agent creates (like a patch file, or a temp model download) are cleaned up or secured.
* [ ] **Compliance Checklist:** Create a checklist of compliance requirements: e.g., **Right to be forgotten** (can we delete a project‚Äôs data from memory if asked?), **Access control** (maybe integrate with OS user accounts or require certain environment variables to be present to run destructive actions), **Audit logging** (as covered in safety, ensure logs are tamper-evident or append-only so they can be used in audits). Engage with any security engineers or refer to standards (like the OWASP guidance for AI systems if exists).
* [ ] **Red Team Test:** Perform a light ‚Äúred team‚Äù exercise where we simulate a malicious or naive agent action. For example, what if the LLM for some reason decides to output system commands or read files outside the repo? Our design should prevent it ‚Äì e.g., the agent shouldn‚Äôt have a tool that executes arbitrary shell commands unless explicitly intended. Ensure that by default, the agent‚Äôs tools are constrained to intended scope (e.g., if we don‚Äôt provide a tool to delete random files, it can‚Äôt do it). We‚Äôll verify that even if the LLM produces some unexpected tool name, it won‚Äôt execute (the Planner should reject tools not in the registry). This will validate our guardrail approach.

### 8. Integration Ecosystem

For the agent to be truly useful, it should integrate smoothly with other tools and workflows developers use:

**Questions to Research:**

* How can our agentic workflow tie into CI/CD pipelines? One idea: the agent could act as an automatic fixer for CI failures. For instance, if a GitHub Action pipeline fails tests, it could trigger our agent to attempt to fix the issue and open a PR. We should explore providing the agent as a CLI in CI environments (maybe with a command like `aw agent ci-fix` that knows it‚Äôs running in a CI context and tries to address issues). Compatibility is key ‚Äì ensure running in headless mode with no human input works, and any needed credentials (for pushing fixes) can be provided. This effectively means the agent becomes part of the DevOps loop, potentially reducing the manual work to fix build issues.
* Compatibility with popular dev tools: e.g., integrating with VS Code or other IDEs. Perhaps a VS Code extension that lets you start an agent from the editor or shows agent suggestions in real time. At minimum, our CLI could output machine-readable status (JSON) that an editor plugin can parse to present a GUI (for instance, listing the agent‚Äôs next planned steps and allowing a ‚Äúapprove/stop‚Äù button). We should identify if there‚Äôs a demand to control the agent from the IDE, and design a simple API or message interface for that.
* Plugin architecture for extensibility: We want the community or other teams to add their own tools or custom agent behaviors. Our CLI is already modular; we can extend that by allowing new Tool Actors to be registered via config or a plugins folder. Research how tools like Jenkins or VS Code handle plugins (often via a manifest and loading mechanism). We might implement a system where a plugin can declare new `aw` commands that automatically become available as Tool Actors to the agent. Documentation and a stable interface for tools (the message schema, lifecycle, etc.) will encourage adoption.
* Migration strategies: Teams have existing scripts and CI jobs. How to gradually introduce agentic workflows? Possibly start by having the agent assist in a non-critical path (like a bot that suggests documentation updates or minor refactors), then build trust. Provide a guide on replacing a manual script with an agent-driven approach (maybe wrapping their script as a tool the agent can call). Emphasize the agent can be run in dry-run or advisory mode at first, before fully automating. Learning from cases where such transitions happened (maybe any blog about adopting AI in CI) would be valuable.

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **CI Integration Testing:** Try to integrate the agent in a GitHub Actions workflow on a sample repo. For example, after tests run, have a step: `npx aw agent fix-tests` (assuming our CLI can be run via npx or installed). The agent would need access to the repo files and commit rights. See if it can create a commit or open a PR. Identify any blockers (like needing an interactive prompt ‚Äì which we should disable or auto-approve in CI mode). Document how to set it up (which tokens or permissions needed). This will form the basis of a how-to for users who want the agent to auto-handle certain failures.
* [ ] **VS Code Extension Prototype:** Using VS Code‚Äôs extension API, experiment with a simple extension that calls our CLI under the hood. For instance, a button ‚ÄúRun Agent on Current Project‚Äù that spawns the agent process and streams output to a panel in the editor. Also possibly intercept certain events ‚Äì e.g., if agent asks for approval, the extension could show a dialog. Even a basic integration like this would improve UX for those who prefer not to run it in a terminal.
* [ ] **Plugin API Design:** Define how a plugin can contribute a new tool. Maybe we allow a plugin to register by providing a JS module exporting a ToolActor class and a schema definition. When the CLI starts, it loads all modules from a `~/.aw/plugins` directory. The agent then sees those tools as available. We will write a short example plugin (maybe a tool that calls an external API, just for demo) to flush out issues. Consider versioning and conflicts (two plugins defining same tool name, etc.). Ensure security of plugins (perhaps sign them or at least warn if loading untrusted code).
* [ ] **Migration Documentation:** Draft a guide for users migrating from existing scripts to agentic workflow. For example: *‚ÄúIf you have a script that lints and formats code, you can make the agent handle it by \[steps]‚Ä¶ If you trust the agent, it can even auto-fix issues it finds.‚Äù* Emphasize that the agent can be adopted gradually: run it in reporting mode first to see what it *would* do, then enable actual writes. We might also create example setups for common workflows (like a repository where the agent manages the release process) to illustrate best practices.

### 9. Evaluation & Metrics

To know if our agent is effective and to drive continuous improvement, we need to establish metrics and evaluation methods:

**Questions to Research:**

* How do we measure an agent‚Äôs success? Some obvious metrics: **Task completion rate** (does the agent achieve the given goal without human intervention, and how often), **Time to completion** (does it actually save time vs a human), and **Quality of outcome** (e.g., code produced passes tests, conform to style, etc.). We may also consider **efficiency** like how many steps or tool calls the agent used ‚Äì fewer may indicate better planning. Also, **user satisfaction** can be gauged via surveys or feedback after agent usage (‚ÄúDid the agent help you?‚Äù).
* What system metrics to track during agent runs? From a performance perspective: average tokens per task, number of LLM calls per task, cost per task (if API calls), and resource usage. These help identify if an agent strategy is too expensive or inefficient. We should implement telemetry for at least: tokens used, API cost (we can compute cost if we know token pricing), duration of agent planning vs execution.
* How to compare agent vs human workflows? One approach is A/B testing on real tasks: have some tasks done by developers manually and similar tasks done by the agent, then compare outcomes. If that‚Äôs not directly possible, we can simulate scenarios. For example, take historical data (past PRs or bug fixes) and see if the agent can solve them (replay the situation). This provides a baseline success rate. Also, measuring how much faster (or slower) the agent was can justify the feature‚Äôs value.
* Creating evaluation scenarios: We might want a suite of test cases for the agent ‚Äì e.g., a set of small buggy programs where the agent is tasked to fix them. This can be run automatically to get a quantitative measure of success. Or for more complex tasks, define criteria of success and have a human judge or a script verify the agent‚Äôs result.
* Monitoring in production: Once in use, gather metrics continuously: things like **agent success rate** (percentage of agent runs that finish without human help), **rollbacks or failures** (how often does the agent have to abort or gets stopped by safety), and improvement over time. Set up an internal dashboard with these metrics to guide tuning.

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **Define Key Metrics:** Concretely list metrics in categories such as:

  * *Effectiveness:* Task success rate, goal completion time, number of human interventions needed per task.
  * *Efficiency:* Average steps (tool calls) per task, average LLM tokens per task, cost per task (for API usage), agent idle time vs work time.
  * *Quality:* E.g., for code-related tasks, did the agent‚Äôs output pass all tests? Was any rework needed? Perhaps measure things like ‚Äúpost-agent error rate‚Äù (how many issues remain after agent finishes).
  * *System performance:* CPU/RAM usage, message throughput while agent runs.
  * *User satisfaction:* perhaps through periodic surveys or simply whether users opt to use the agent (adoption rate).
* [ ] **Instrumentation:** Implement code to gather these metrics. For instance, the PlannerActor can count how many tool calls were made and how many tokens used (if we get that info from the LLM API or estimate by prompt size). It can record start and end times to get duration. On completion, it can emit a summary event with all these metrics. We can log these to a file or a database for analysis. Also include counts of certain events (like how many times safety check blocked an action).
* [ ] **Automated Task Suite:** Create a set of representative tasks for the agent to attempt. This could include: fixing a known buggy function, performing a refactor, syncing a branch with upstream, resolving a synthetic merge conflict, etc. For each, we have the initial state and the expected outcome. Run the agent on each and see if it achieves the expected outcome. This will act as a regression test suite for the agent as we improve it. It‚Äôs essentially unit tests for the agent‚Äôs capabilities. Over time, expand this suite as we encounter new scenarios.
* [ ] **Benchmark Against Manual:** If possible, find some historical examples or do a live test where developers solve a set of issues and measure time, then let the agent solve similar ones. The comparison might be qualitative, but even anecdotal evidence from trial deployments can be useful (‚ÄúAgent fixed 5 of 10 failing build issues on its own, saving X hours of developer time‚Äù). Collect these case studies to illustrate the agent‚Äôs value or identify weaknesses (e.g., ‚ÄúAgent struggled with issue type Y that humans solved easily‚Äù).
* [ ] **A/B Testing Framework:** If we have enough usage, we could do A/B where some tasks the agent auto-handles, and others require manual steps, and see differences in cycle time or outcomes. However, implementing true A/B might be complex in a dev tool context. Instead, we might rely on opt-in telemetry from early adopters. Ensure that if users consent, our tool can send anonymous usage stats (like success/failure counts) to us for analysis. This will help tune the system based on real-world data.
* [ ] **Continuous Evaluation and Improvement:** Plan for a periodic review (maybe each sprint) of agent performance. Look at metrics and identify areas to improve. For example, if we see ‚ÄúTask success rate = 60%‚Äù, investigate the 40% failures to find common causes (maybe always failing on a certain type of task). Then feed those findings into refining either prompts, adding new tools, or adjusting strategies. Essentially create a feedback loop for ourselves as creators to iterate on the agent.

### 10. Recovery & Rollback

Even with careful design, some agent actions might go wrong or only partially complete. We need robust recovery and rollback mechanisms so that failures don‚Äôt leave the system or repository in a bad state:

**Questions to Research:**

* How to handle partial failures in multi-step workflows? For instance, if the agent was in the middle of a 5-step plan and step 3 fails (perhaps applying a patch failed due to new merge conflict), what then? Ideally, the agent can attempt to recover: maybe re-plan from the current state. If it cannot, it should at least not leave things broken. We might need the agent to checkpoint state before risky operations so it can roll back. For example, before applying code changes, it could stash or branch the current work so that it can undo if needed.
* State recovery after crashes: If the agent process or system crashes, how do we resume? One approach: regularly persist the agent‚Äôs state (goal, progress, any intermediate results) to disk or the vector store. On restart, an agent could read the last checkpoint and continue. Alternatively, design agents to be short-lived (finish tasks in one session), so recovery means just informing the user that it failed and maybe restarting from scratch. But for long tasks, resuming is valuable. We should look at patterns from workflow engines where they store execution state. Maybe our memory DB can serve as that ‚Äì e.g., logging each completed step so a new agent can pick up.
* Rollback of destructive operations: If the agent performs an operation that needs undo (like it deleted a bunch of lines in code incorrectly), how to revert? In code, Git gives an easy rollback path (we can always revert a commit or reset to previous state). We should leverage that: perhaps instruct the agent that any major code change should be committed in a new branch so we can revert if needed. If it made changes in working copy and didn‚Äôt commit, maybe maintain a diff so it can be reversed. For other operations (like toggling a feature flag or deploying something), we‚Äôd have to have tool-specific rollback (like call a corresponding ‚Äúundo‚Äù tool if available).
* Checkpoint and resume strategies: Determine at what granularity we checkpoint. Possibly after each significant subtask, we mark a state. A simple checkpoint can be a Git commit or stash for code changes. For the agent‚Äôs own context (LLM conversation), maybe we don‚Äôt try to save the entire LLM state (since that‚Äôs implicit in conversation), but rather reconstruct it from history if needed. If using a reproducible planning approach (like always re-prompt from scratch with relevant history), then stateless restart is feasible. If we maintain a chain-of-thought internally, we might serialize it. We should also handle external interruptions ‚Äì e.g., if a user hits Ctrl+C, maybe we keep the partial work somewhere so they can resume or at least inspect it later.

**Research Tasks:**

* [ ] **Transactional Workflow Design:** For each type of multi-step operation, outline how to make it transactional. A classic pattern is Saga: each step has a compensating action if a later step fails. We will map our common scenarios (e.g., release process might involve updating version, building, pushing a tag, publishing package). If publishing fails at the end, how to undo earlier steps? Maybe by not pushing the tag or reverting the version bump commit. Document these compensations and possibly implement them in the agent logic (the agent could be prompted or coded to perform rollbacks on failure).
* [ ] **Incorporate Git Rollbacks:** Leverage Git for safety. Ensure the agent frequently commits or checkpoints changes on separate branches. If something fails, the main branch or key branches remain untouched. We can even auto-revert changes if needed. Implement a feature where the agent, upon abort, can offer ‚ÄúRollback changes? (Y/N)‚Äù to the user, which would use Git reset or revert to undo any commits it made. Test this by simulating an agent making a change and then encountering an error ‚Äì verify that our rollback restores the repo to original state.
* [ ] **Crash Recovery Testing:** Force-kill the agent process mid-operation to see what happens. For example, agent was running tests when killed. On restart, can we detect that there was an ongoing agent session? Perhaps we write a temp file with the agent‚Äôs state (what it was doing). Evaluate if it‚Äôs feasible to restart automatically. It might be simpler to just notify the user on next run that ‚Äúprevious session did not complete.‚Äù However, if partial changes were made (like some files edited), we should inform the user or attempt to clean up. Possibly utilize `git stash` at the start of agent run to encapsulate any changes, and pop it at the end only if successful, so an abrupt termination means changes are still stashed (thus not affecting the working tree).
* [ ] **Incremental Checkpoint Mechanisms:** Implement a minimal checkpoint scheme: e.g., after each tool action, append a log entry to a ‚Äúagent\_journal.json‚Äù file. This could record: step description, outcome, any artifacts (like ‚Äúcreated branch X‚Äù). If the agent stops, this journal can be used to restart or at least to manually follow what was done. We‚Äôll prototype reading this journal to resume: the agent could read what steps were done and skip them if they are idempotent or re-execute if needed. For instance, if journal says ‚Äúmerged branch feature -> staging‚Äù, the resumed agent knows that‚Äôs done. This is complex, but even a partial solution (like not redoing completed Git merges) is useful.
* [ ] **Research Workflow Orchestration Patterns:** Look at how tools like Airflow or Temporal handle long workflows and retries. They often have check-pointing and the ability to continue after failures. We might not implement something that heavy, but we can borrow ideas like unique IDs for tasks, and the concept of idempotent tasks for safe retry. Write a short summary of any relevant pattern (e.g., Saga pattern for distributed transactions, event sourcing, etc.) and see which could apply. If we find a fit (like event sourcing the agent‚Äôs actions to replay them), we might incorporate that in a future version.
* [ ] **Test End-to-End Recovery:** Simulate a scenario: The agent is doing a multi-step release and something fails. Ensure our system handles it gracefully: the repository is not left in a broken half-released state, the agent informs the user of what happened, and any temp state is cleaned or saved. Ideally, the user or a new agent run can pick up from that point. Iterate on the process until these failure cases feel manageable and not catastrophic.

## üéØ Research Priorities

Given the breadth of areas, we will tackle them in phases, focusing first on enabling core capabilities, then proving them out, and finally polishing for production-readiness:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1‚Äì3) ‚Äì **Building on Current Assets**

1. **Tool Actor Protocol (Highest Priority):** Begin by converting key CLI commands into Tool Actors (Git, Validation, Test). This provides the ‚Äúhands‚Äù for the agent. It‚Äôs highest priority because everything else (LLM planning, memory) depends on the agent being able to take actions. Deliverable: a working set of tool actors and a basic PlannerActor that can call them (even if manually triggered).
2. **Memory Architecture:** Implement the vector store and memory querying mechanism early. This is a new capability that will significantly enhance the agent‚Äôs context. By prototyping this in Phase 1, we can start accumulating useful memory during our tests. Deliverable: a running vector DB (likely start with SQLite-VSS or Chroma locally) and functions to add/query memory.
3. **LLM Integration Strategy:** Integrate an initial LLM (e.g. OpenAI API or a small local model) with the PlannerActor to prove out the loop of ‚ÄúLLM thinks -> tool executes -> result back to LLM‚Äù. Early integration will expose any challenges with prompt design or tool formatting. Aim to have a demo where the agent can complete a simple multi-step task by end of Week 3.
4. **Safety Framework:** Even in early prototypes, bake in safety. Implement a basic allowlist/denylist for tool usage so we don‚Äôt accidentally do something bad during testing. Also add iteration limits to avoid infinite loops. This ensures our early agent trials don‚Äôt run amok.

*(By the end of Phase 1, we should have a minimal agent loop functioning with tools, memory, and an LLM, all within the safe constraints of a test environment.)*

### Phase 2: Implementation (Weeks 4‚Äì6) ‚Äì **Prove Agentic Capabilities**

1. **User Experience Enhancements:** Now that the core is working, improve the CLI interface. Develop the `aw agent` commands, the status dashboard for agents, and interaction flows. During this phase, we‚Äôll likely run longer agent sessions, so having good UX to monitor them is crucial.
2. **Performance & Scalability Testing:** With a functioning agent, measure its impact. Use increasingly large scenarios to ensure the message throughput and system performance stay high. Optimize any slow points discovered. By week 6, we want confidence that the agent doesn‚Äôt degrade our 10√ó validation speed significantly (perhaps a slight overhead is fine, but no major slowdowns for common tasks). We may need to fine-tune how often the agent calls the LLM or how it batches operations to meet this goal.
3. **Integration Ecosystem Extensions:** Start integrating with external systems. Perhaps by week 5, try a CI pipeline demo or the VS Code extension prototype. Also, flesh out the plugin architecture so others can start writing tool extensions. This will prove that our design isn‚Äôt a closed silo but can work in the broader developer ecosystem.

*(By the end of Phase 2, we should have demonstrated an agent autonomously handling non-trivial developer workflows, with users able to interact via CLI or even external triggers, all without regressing performance on existing features.)*

### Phase 3: Production (Weeks 7‚Äì9) ‚Äì **Polish and Deploy**

1. **Privacy & Security Hardening:** Before broader rollout, address all identified privacy concerns. Implement the local-only mode thoroughly, ensure data encryption where needed, finalize the allow/deny rules for tools. Basically make the agent ‚Äúenterprise-ready,‚Äù as this is often a gating factor for adoption in real projects.
2. **Evaluation & Metrics Collection:** Set up the telemetry and metrics dashboard. As we deploy to a pilot group or internal team, have clear metrics being collected to measure success criteria. By week 9, we should be able to produce a report on agent performance vs manual, agent success rates, etc., to justify moving to production use.
3. **Recovery & Rollback Mechanisms:** Finalize the reliability aspects. Implement the checkpointing and rollback features that were prototyped, and test them thoroughly (including chaos testing like random kill of agent). This is about ensuring that if something goes wrong, we can recover easily and safely, which is critical for production trust.

*(By the end of Phase 3, the agentic workflow features should be robust, secure, and well-integrated. We‚Äôll have documentation and safeguards in place so that we can enable it for real projects with confidence.)*

*Note:* We shortened the timeline from 12 to 9 weeks because our existing foundation provides many building blocks (we don‚Äôt have to build everything from scratch). Each phase focuses on making sure we leverage those strengths while adding the new ‚Äúagent‚Äù capabilities incrementally.

## üìã Research Deliverables

For each research area and phase, we will produce:

* **Technical Analysis Documents:** Detailed write-ups of findings in areas like LLM integration (e.g. results of benchmarking different models with data and costs), memory store comparisons (pros/cons of SQLite vs Chroma vs Pinecone with our use-case data), and safety considerations (summaries of guidelines and how we implement them). These analyses provide the evidence and rationale behind our design decisions. All key questions listed in each area will be answered with supporting references or experimental data in these documents.
* **Prototype Code and Demos:** Working examples demonstrating the key concepts. For instance, a small prototype of the PlannerActor using GPT-4 to decide on running a dummy tool, or a script showing vector search over past commit messages. Where possible, this will be in our codebase (behind feature flags perhaps), so we can iterate on it. The code will serve as a proof-of-concept for each idea before we fully integrate it.
* **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** We will maintain ADRs for major choices ‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúDecision: Use SQLite-VSS for local memory store vs adopting Pinecone cloud ‚Äì chosen SQLite-VSS due to privacy and sufficient scale for our needs.‚Äù Each ADR will document options considered, trade-offs, and the justification for the final decision. This ensures future maintainers understand why we built things a certain way, and provides a paper trail for stakeholders.
* **Implementation Plan & Roadmap:** A living document (likely updating the roadmap outlined above) with specific tasks, owners, and timelines. After research, this will be refined into engineering tickets. It will map research findings to concrete development steps. For example, if research found that a smaller model works well for planning, the implementation plan will include integrating that model in our infrastructure. This plan will be aligned with the phased approach and will be used to track progress.
* **Risk Assessment Register:** A list of identified risks (technical, operational, ethical) with mitigation strategies for each. For example, ‚ÄúRisk: LLM may hallucinate a dangerous git command ‚Äì Mitigation: strict allowlist enforcement in Tool Actor.‚Äù We will update this as research uncovers new risks or validates existing ones. By project end, we expect to have mitigations in place for all high and medium risks.

Additionally, we will present demo videos or live demonstrations at the end of each phase to stakeholders, showcasing the agent performing tasks ‚Äì this is not a ‚Äúdocument‚Äù per se, but an important deliverable to prove functionality and get feedback early.

## üîÑ Research Methodology

Our approach to this research is iterative and evidence-driven, combining literature review with practical experimentation:

1. **Literature & Prior Art Review:** We start by studying existing systems and research papers for each area. For LLM planning, we read about frameworks like OpenAI‚Äôs Agents SDK, LangChain, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude with tools, etc., to gather best practices. Memory systems research includes vector DB blogs and benchmarks (for instance, understanding how Pinecone or Chroma perform and scale). Safety literature from OpenAI/Anthropic will inform our guardrails. We won‚Äôt reinvent the wheel if solutions exist externally; instead, we‚Äôll adapt them to our context.
2. **Prototype Development:** For each hypothesis or design idea, we implement a minimal prototype to test it. This could mean writing a small script to call an LLM with a certain prompt format to see if it produces the desired output, or setting up a vector search on sample data to verify speed and relevance. These prototypes are usually throwaway code or temporary integrations in our dev environment. The goal is to validate concepts quickly before committing to them.
3. **Comparative Analysis:** Where choices exist (like selecting a model or database), we do side-by-side comparisons. For instance, run the same planning task with GPT-4 vs Llama-2 and compare outputs; or load the same 10k embeddings into Chroma and SQLite and measure query latency. We‚Äôll tabulate results and weigh them on factors like accuracy, speed, cost, ease of integration. This data-driven approach will guide decisions (and feed into our ADRs).
4. **Performance Testing:** We incorporate performance tests as part of research, not just after building everything. As soon as a component is in prototype, we measure its resource usage and response time in a scenario close to real use. This way, if something is too slow (e.g. an embedding search taking 500ms, or an LLM call using too many tokens), we identify it early and look for optimizations or alternatives. We also ensure to test under conditions simulating real workloads (multiple tasks, larger code bases) rather than just trivial cases.
5. **User Research & Feedback:** Since this agent will directly assist developers, their input is vital. We will involve a small set of developers (maybe internally or friendly users) to try early versions or respond to design ideas. For example, show them a sample CLI session with the agent and get feedback on whether the output is understandable or what they‚Äôd want differently. If possible, conduct short interviews or surveys about their pain points that an agent could solve ‚Äì ensuring our features align with actual needs.
6. **Expert Consultation:** Leverage experts either within the company or in the community. If we have ML engineers, get their take on our LLM integration. Security team members can review our safety plans. Perhaps reach out to communities (Stack Overflow, etc.) if we hit a challenge (e.g., best practice for tool invocation formatting) ‚Äì often others have faced similar issues. Also, any known thought leaders (like reading blog posts from those building similar agents) to gather insights. We might even connect with authors of relevant tools (like maintainers of Chroma or LangChain) for specific questions.

By cycling through these steps for each major research question, we ensure our final design is well-founded. We document as we go, so the knowledge flows into the deliverables continuously. The methodology is not strictly linear; we may bounce back and forth (e.g., build a prototype, find an issue, go back to literature to see how others solved it, then prototype a solution). This agile research approach lets us adapt as we discover new information.

## üìä Success Criteria

We will consider the research phase successful when we meet the following criteria (with evidence to back each one):

* **All Key Questions Answered:** For each of the 10 research areas above, we have clear answers or decisions documented. For example, LLM integration questions about which model to use ‚Äì answered by saying, ‚ÄúUse Model X for these tasks because‚Ä¶‚Äù. There should be no open unknowns by the end of research; if some remain, we explicitly note them and perhaps plan how to resolve during implementation.
* **Architecture Decisions Documented:** Every major architectural choice (memory store, tool protocol, etc.) is recorded along with rationale. Anyone reading our docs should understand *why* we chose a certain approach, with references to research findings (e.g., benchmarks or external sources).
* **Prototype Validation of Key Concepts:** We have at least one prototype or test proving each key concept works. For instance, we demonstrate an LLM successfully controlling a tool actor in a safe manner, or show the vector search returning relevant past events. The prototypes don‚Äôt have to be full production quality, but they should be enough to de-risk the idea. We also measure that the prototype performance is within acceptable range (no showstoppers like a single query taking 10 seconds, etc.).
* **Implementation Plan Ready:** A detailed plan for turning this research into a working feature, broken into tasks and phases, is completed. It should include realistic timelines and any resource needs (like ‚Äúrequire access to GPT-4 API‚Äù or ‚Äúneed a GPU server for local model‚Äù). If the research discovered that some parts are especially complex or risky, the plan accounts for that (maybe with a spike or additional testing phase). Essentially, the output is actionable for the engineering team to start coding with minimal ambiguity.
* **Risk Assessment & Mitigation:** All significant risks identified have mitigation strategies in place. For example, if a risk was ‚ÄúAgent may degrade performance under load,‚Äù the mitigation might be ‚ÄúAdd monitoring and auto-disable agent mode if CPU > 90%‚Äù or similar. No high risk is left unaddressed. We also ensure that for any safety risks, we have implemented appropriate guardrails (and perhaps tested them in scenarios).
* **User Experience Validated:** Through either user testing or internal dogfooding, we validate that the planned UX is intuitive. Success looks like a developer being able to run the agent for a scenario and understand what it did, and express confidence or at least constructive feedback. If early users find it confusing or unhelpful, we iterate until we hit a satisfactory experience. This criterion may be softer to measure, but basically we want at least a few positive confirmations from target users that this agent would indeed be useful and they‚Äôd trust it (with the safety we‚Äôve built in).
* **Specific Key Goals Achieved:** We had some explicit goals from the outset:

  * **Agentic Bridge:** Demonstrated that the agent can bridge from high-level goal to executing low-level CLI commands (autonomously). For example, we can show a scenario: ‚ÄúGoal: release new version‚Äù and the agent performs a series of `aw` commands to do it. This proves the concept of going from intent to action via our Tool Actors.
  * **Performance Validation:** Shown that the new agent system doesn‚Äôt significantly regress the performance of our existing workflow. Ideally, running the agent is as fast or faster than a human running the equivalent steps, and our validation still runs at 10√ó speed overall. We will specifically measure a heavy validation scenario with and without the agent to ensure that speedup holds.
  * **Memory Integration:** Verify that the agent‚Äôs memory works in practice ‚Äì e.g., the agent can remember context from earlier in the session or retrieve something from last week‚Äôs work. A test success example: the agent encounters a repeat of a previous error and uses memory to recall the solution, solving it faster. This shows persistent memory is functional.
  * **Safety Extension:** Demonstrate that our safety measures work by testing some malicious or incorrect scenarios (like agent tries to do a forbidden operation and gets blocked appropriately, or triggers a human approval at the right time). The supervisor should handle an agent crash gracefully, etc. Basically, the agent should be at least as safe as a cautious developer ‚Äì it shouldn‚Äôt do anything irreversible without checks.

When all the above are satisfied, we can consider the research phase complete and have confidence moving forward with full implementation. We will have reduced uncertainty to a minimum and ensured stakeholders (dev team, security, product, and end-users) are on board with the approach. The final deliverable of research might also include an updated roadmap and maybe a presentation to summarize how the new ‚Äúagentic workflow‚Äù will roll out.

## üöÄ Next Steps

Following the completion of the research, the project will move into execution. The immediate next steps will be:

1. **Assign Research Leads to Implementation Tasks:** The knowledge gathered will be handed off or taken up by specific engineers for each area. For example, if one person dove deep into memory architecture, they might lead the implementation of the memory module. We‚Äôll ensure clear owners for Tool Actor development, LLM integration, etc., aligning with the Phase 1/2/3 priorities. The research documents will serve as the blueprint for their work.
2. **Create Engineering Sprints/Tasks:** Using the implementation plan, break down work into sprint-sized chunks and create Jira tickets (or our tracking of choice). Each task should reference the research finding that informs it. For instance, a task ‚ÄúImplement PlannerActor prompting logic‚Äù will reference the prompt templates decided during research. We‚Äôll also include time for writing tests and performing the evaluations outlined.
3. **Set Up Prototype Environment:** Before building fully in production code, set up an isolated environment for agent testing. This might be a separate branch or a toggle in the app to enable ‚Äúagent mode.‚Äù We want to test safely without affecting real projects initially. This environment can use dummy repositories to simulate scenarios or a sandbox repo on GitHub for integration testing. We‚Äôll also integrate any needed external services (get API keys for LLMs, install vector DB locally, etc.) in this environment.
4. **Begin Implementation with Literature at Hand:** Start coding the components, frequently referring back to the research docs to ensure alignment. We should also keep an eye on new developments in this fast-moving field ‚Äì part of ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù is staying updated. (E.g., if OpenAI or others release a new tool or model during our implementation, evaluate if it affects our plan.)
5. **Regular Check-ins and Iterative Development:** Schedule weekly (or even more frequent) meetings for the team to review progress and any surprises encountered. At these, compare results to the research predictions. If something isn‚Äôt working as expected, decide if we need additional research or to pivot. These also keep stakeholders updated ‚Äì we might demo incremental progress to show the agent doing gradually more complex things.
6. **Testing & Feedback Loops:** As features get implemented, test them in realistic scenarios (possibly using the evaluation suite developed during research). Also get early users (maybe internal beta testers) to try the agent on real tasks. Their feedback will guide final tweaks. Plan a broader alpha/beta release of the feature once we‚Äôve tested in-house, to get more feedback under real conditions.

Ultimately, the research will have paved the way, but execution will require discipline to follow the plan while remaining agile to adjust to any unforeseen issues. By having done comprehensive groundwork, we expect the implementation to be smoother and faster, leading to a successful launch of agentic workflow capabilities in our product.
