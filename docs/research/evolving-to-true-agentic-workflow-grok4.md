# Research Report: Evolving to True Agentic Workflow

This report synthesizes research findings from literature reviews, comparative analyses, and conceptual prototyping to bridge from the current Actor-Web and Agent-Workflow CLI foundation to autonomous agentic behavior. It addresses each research area with the required deliverables, leveraging existing assets like message-passing actors, XState integration, and CLI commands. Findings draw from established agentic frameworks (e.g., LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen) and benchmarks on LLMs, vector stores, and safety practices.

## 1. LLM Integration Strategy

### Technical Analysis
Integrating LLMs with CLI commands like `aw:validate`, `aw:ship`, and `aw:sync` can be achieved via tool-calling protocols, where LLMs act as planners invoking tools. Best models for cost/performance in planning tasks (as of 2025) include Mixtral-8x7B (open-source, high reasoning at low cost), Claude 3.7 Sonnet (~$3-15/M tokens, balanced), and GPT-4.1 (~$5-10/M tokens, top performance). Local execution (e.g., via Ollama) offers privacy and low latency (~100ms) but limited capabilities; cloud APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) provide superior performance but introduce latency (~500ms) and privacy risks. Token budgets can be managed with structured outputs and caching; prompts for git/testing use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) patterns like "Think step-by-step: Analyze git diff, validate changes, suggest fixes." Fallbacks include local models or rule-based heuristics when APIs fail. Streaming suits long loops for real-time feedback, while batch processing optimizes costs.

### Prototype Code
Pseudocode for PlannerActor in JavaScript (Node.js), integrating with existing CLI via child_process:

```javascript
const { Actor } = require('actor-web'); // Assuming Actor-Web import
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const openai = require('openai'); // Or local Ollama

class PlannerActor extends Actor {
  async onMessage(msg) {
    const prompt = `Plan git operation: ${msg.task}. Use tools: aw:validate, aw:ship. Output JSON: {tool: "aw:validate", args: {...}}`;
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4.1',
      messages: [{ role: 'system', content: prompt }],
      stream: true // For long-running loops
    });
    // Parse JSON tool call
    const toolCall = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
    exec(`${toolCall.tool} ${JSON.stringify(toolCall.args)}`, (err, stdout) => {
      this.send({ result: stdout, error: err }); // Reply via mailbox
    });
  }
}

// Usage: Integrate with XState for state management
```

### Architecture Decisions
Use hybrid LLM (cloud for complex planning, local for simple tasks) to balance trade-offs. Adopt ReAct pattern for prompts to leverage existing GitOperations. Decision rationale: Maintains 10x validation speed by offloading only planning.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 1: Benchmark models (Ollama vs. OpenAI) on sample tasks.
- Week 2: Develop prompt templates and integrate with CLI.
- Week 3: Test scenarios like merge conflicts.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: API downtime – Mitigate with local fallbacks. Risk: High costs – Use token limits and monitoring. Challenge: Hallucinations – Validate outputs with existing services.

## 2. Memory Architecture & Vector Storage

### Technical Analysis
Optimal structure for workflow context: Episodic memory (events/outcomes as embeddings) + semantic (code/commits via vector search). SQLite-VSS excels in local efficiency (low storage, fast queries for small projects); Chroma offers better scalability for embeddings; Pinecone suits cloud-based, large-scale with high query performance but higher costs. Embeddings via Sentence Transformers for code; prune via TTL or relevance scoring to manage growth.

| Vector DB | Query Performance | Storage Efficiency | Use Case Fit |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| SQLite-VSS | High (local) | Excellent (embedded) | Small repos, privacy-focused |
| Chroma | Medium | Good (open-source) | Medium projects, flexible |
| Pinecone | High (cloud) | Moderate | Large teams, scalable |

### Prototype Code
Python example for embedding/retrieval (integrate via API to JS actors):

```python
import sqlite3
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
conn = sqlite3.connect('memory.db')
conn.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS episodes (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, embedding BLOB, context TEXT)')

def store_episode(context):
    embedding = model.encode(context)
    conn.execute('INSERT INTO episodes (embedding, context) VALUES (?, ?)', (embedding.tobytes(), context))
    conn.commit()

def retrieve_similar(query, top_k=5):
    q_emb = model.encode(query)
    results = conn.execute('SELECT context FROM episodes ORDER BY cosine_similarity(embedding, ?) DESC LIMIT ?', (q_emb.tobytes(), top_k))
    return [row[0] for row in results.fetchall()]

# Usage: retrieve_similar("merge conflict resolution")
```

### Architecture Decisions
Choose SQLite-VSS for initial integration (leverages local privacy, low overhead). Rationale: Aligns with existing CLI's performance; hybrid with Pinecone for scaling.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 1: Set up schema and test embeddings.
- Week 2: Benchmark retrieval on project histories.
- Week 3: Integrate with Actor mailboxes for state persistence.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: Query latency in large histories – Mitigate with indexing. Challenge: Embedding drift – Retrain periodically.

## 3. Tool Actor Protocol Design

### Technical Analysis
Wrap CLI commands as Tool Actors using JSON schemas for messages (e.g., {action: "validate", params: {branch: "main"}}). Error handling: Exponential backoff retries; supervision from existing strategies. Resource management: Actor lifecycles for handles. Discovery: Dynamic registration via ActorRef broadcast.

### Prototype Code
JS example converting CLI to Tool Actor:

```javascript
class GitActor extends Actor {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.schema = { action: 'string', params: 'object' }; // JSON schema
  }
  async onMessage(msg) {
    if (msg.action === 'validate') {
      exec('aw:validate', (err) => {
        if (err) this.retry(msg); // Autonomous retry
        else this.reply({ success: true });
      });
    }
  }
  retry(msg) {
    // Exponential backoff logic
    setTimeout(() => this.onMessage(msg), 1000);
  }
}
```

### Architecture Decisions
Adopt MCP (Model Context Protocol) for interoperability over simple function calling. Rationale: Enhances existing supervision for dynamic tools.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 1: Convert 3 CLI commands to actors.
- Week 2: Design schemas and test orchestration.
- Week 3: Prototype lifecycle with supervision.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: Interop issues – Validate schemas strictly. Challenge: Resource leaks – Monitor via actors.

## 4. Safety & Governance Framework

### Technical Analysis
Extend supervision for agents with guardrails (e.g., deny lists for force-push). Prevent destructiveness via intent checks; rate limiting with token budgets. Human-in-loop for merges; audits via logging.

### Prototype Code
JS Supervisor extension:

```javascript
class SafetySupervisor extends Supervisor {
  beforeAction(action) {
    if (action.includes('force-push')) throw new Error('Denied');
    // Human approval
    if (action.isSensitive) return confirmHuman(`Approve ${action}?`);
  }
  onFailure(err) {
    this.rollback(); // Use Git revert
  }
}
```

### Architecture Decisions
Incorporate Anthropic/OpenAI safety guidelines. Rationale: Builds on existing strategies without overhead.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 1: Define allow/deny lists.
- Week 2: Prototype approvals.
- Week 3: Test rollbacks.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: Over-restriction – Tune via testing. Challenge: Audit compliance – Encrypt logs.

## 5. Performance & Scalability

### Technical Analysis
Maintain 10K+ msg/sec by optimizing planning loops (caching, async tools). Memory usage: ~1GB/session with pruning; bottlenecks in IO for planning. Scale via distributed actors; cache validations.

### Prototype Code
Benchmark snippet (JS):

```javascript
const benchmark = require('benchmark');
new benchmark.Suite()
  .add('PlanningLoop', () => plannerActor.send({task: 'validate'}))
  .on('cycle', event => console.log(event.target))
  .run();
```

### Architecture Decisions
Use async message-passing for concurrency. Rationale: Preserves existing speedup.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 4: Benchmark overhead.
- Week 5: Profile memory.
- Week 6: Test concurrent repos.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: Overhead regression – Monitor metrics. Challenge: Scaling costs – Optimize caching.

## 6. User Experience & Interaction Design

### Technical Analysis
Evolve CLI dashboard with agent status (e.g., progress bars). New commands: `aw agent run/pause`; visualize via terminal UI. Interrupt via signals; learn from corrections.

### Prototype Code
CLI extension (using Ink for UI):

```javascript
const { h, render } = require('ink');
render(<ProgressBar value={agentProgress} />); // For long tasks
```

### Architecture Decisions
Adopt goal-oriented UX for agents. Rationale: Enhances existing dashboard.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 4: Extend `aw:status`.
- Week 5: Design new interfaces.
- Week 6: Test feedback.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: UI complexity – Keep minimal. Challenge: User adoption – Provide guides.

## 7. Privacy & Security

### Technical Analysis
Handle data locally where possible; encrypt embeddings. Local execution for sensitive code; compliance via OWASP AI guidelines.

### Prototype Code
Encryption example:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
function encryptContext(context) {
  return crypto.createCipher('aes-256', 'key').update(context, 'utf8', 'hex');
}
```

### Architecture Decisions
Air-gapped mode for enterprises. Rationale: Addresses privacy implications.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 7: Analyze data flows.
- Week 8: Test offline modes.
- Week 9: Design compliance features.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: Data leaks – Use local LLMs. Challenge: Encryption overhead – Optimize keys.

## 8. Integration Ecosystem

### Technical Analysis
Integrate with CI/CD via agent triggers in pipelines. Compatible with VS Code via extensions; plugin API for tools. Migration: Gradual from automation to agents.

### Prototype Code
GitHub Actions example:

```yaml
jobs:
  agent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: aw agent run --goal "validate PR"
```

### Architecture Decisions
Extend CLI modularity for plugins. Rationale: Builds on Git operations.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 4: Test with GitHub Actions.
- Week 5: Prototype VS Code extension.
- Week 6: Create migration guides.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: Compatibility issues – Test integrations. Challenge: Plugin security – Vet extensions.

## 9. Evaluation & Metrics

### Technical Analysis
Metrics: Goal completion rate, efficiency (time/tokens), satisfaction (user feedback). A/B testing via benchmarks; compare to human workflows.

### Prototype Code
Metric collection:

```javascript
function evaluateAgent(result) {
  return { success: result.completed, time: Date.now() - start };
}
```

### Architecture Decisions
Opt-in telemetry. Rationale: Privacy-preserving.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 7: Define metrics.
- Week 8: Design telemetry.
- Week 9: Create benchmarks.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: Biased metrics – Use diverse tests. Challenge: Privacy in telemetry – Anonymize.

## 10. Recovery & Rollback

### Technical Analysis
Handle failures with checkpoints; recover state via persistent memory. Rollback via Git revert; transactional workflows.

### Prototype Code
Rollback in actor:

```javascript
function rollback() {
  exec('git revert HEAD');
}
```

### Architecture Decisions
3-minute recovery strategy. Rationale: Minimizes downtime.

### Implementation Plan
- Week 7: Design transactions.
- Week 8: Test recovery.
- Week 9: Prototype checkpoints.

### Risk Assessment
Risk: Incomplete rollbacks – Test thoroughly. Challenge: Crash handling – Use supervision.
