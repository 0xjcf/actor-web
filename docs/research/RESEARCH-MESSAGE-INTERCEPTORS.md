# Research Prompt: Actor System Message Interceptors Implementation

## 1. Clear Title
**Research Prompt: Design Patterns and Performance Considerations for Actor System Message Interceptors**

## 2. Project Context
We are developing the **Actor-Web Architecture framework** - a Pure Actor Model implementation for building resilient, scalable web applications. The project has completed:
- Core actor system with true async messaging via mailboxes (BoundedMailbox)
- Orleans-style virtual actors with caching (90%+ cache hit rates)
- XState v5 integration for state machines
- Request/Response patterns (ask pattern)
- Event emission support

We are now implementing **Message Interceptors** to enable middleware patterns for cross-cutting concerns like logging, metrics, validation, and retry logic without modifying actor behavior.

## 3. Core Problem Statement
We need to implement a message interceptor system that:
1. Allows pre/post message processing without blocking actor performance
2. Maintains the 10,000+ messages/second throughput target
3. Supports both global and per-actor interceptors
4. Handles async interceptor operations properly
5. Provides proper error isolation (interceptor failures shouldn't break message flow)

Key design decisions needed:
- Where in the message pipeline to place interceptor hooks
- How to handle interceptor ordering and priority
- Whether to support message mutation or only observation
- How to minimize performance overhead

## 4. Current Setup / Environment

### Target Architecture
```typescript
// Proposed interceptor interface
interface MessageInterceptor {
  beforeSend?: (message: ActorMessage, target: ActorAddress) => Promise<ActorMessage | null>;
  beforeReceive?: (message: ActorMessage, actor: ActorAddress) => Promise<ActorMessage | null>;
  afterProcess?: (message: ActorMessage, result: unknown, actor: ActorAddress) => Promise<void>;
  onError?: (error: Error, message: ActorMessage, actor: ActorAddress) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Current Message Flow
```typescript
// Simplified current flow in ActorSystemImpl
async send(address: ActorAddress, message: ActorMessage): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Message creation
  // 2. Enqueue to mailbox
  const mailbox = this.actorMailboxes.get(address.path);
  mailbox.enqueue(message);
  // 3. Trigger processing loop if needed
}

async processActorMessages(address: ActorAddress, behavior: ActorBehavior): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Dequeue from mailbox
  const message = await mailbox.dequeue();
  // 2. Process with behavior
  const result = await behavior.onMessage(message, context);
  // 3. Handle result and emitted events
}
```

## 5. Build & Run Commands
```bash
# Build and test
pnpm build
pnpm test:runtime

# Run specific interceptor tests (once implemented)
pnpm test packages/actor-core-runtime/src/tests/interceptors.test.ts
```

## 6. Troubleshooting Steps Already Taken & Observations

### Research Completed
1. **Reviewed existing actor frameworks:**
   - Akka uses "message adapters" and "interceptors" 
   - Orleans uses "filters" and "interceptors"
   - Proto.Actor uses "middleware" pattern
   
2. **Analyzed current codebase:**
   - Message flow is already async via mailboxes
   - Multiple hook points available (enqueue, dequeue, process)
   - Need to maintain fire-and-forget semantics

3. **Performance considerations identified:**
   - Interceptor chains must be pre-compiled/cached
   - Avoid Promise creation for sync interceptors
   - Consider using WeakMap for per-actor interceptor storage

## 7. Specific Questions for Research

### Q1: Interceptor Placement and Performance
**What are the performance implications of placing interceptors at different points in the message pipeline?**
- Before enqueue (sender-side) vs after dequeue (receiver-side)?
- Impact on message ordering guarantees?
- Best practices from high-performance actor systems?

### Q2: Chain of Responsibility Implementation
**What are the most efficient patterns for implementing interceptor chains in JavaScript/TypeScript?**
- Compile-time optimization techniques?
- Avoiding intermediate Promise allocations?
- Fast-path for no interceptors case?

### Q3: Error Handling and Isolation
**How do other actor frameworks handle interceptor failures?**
- Should interceptor errors fail the message or just log?
- Circuit breaker patterns for faulty interceptors?
- Timeout handling for slow interceptors?

### Q4: Message Mutation vs Observation
**What are the trade-offs between allowing interceptors to mutate messages vs read-only observation?**
- Type safety implications?
- Debugging complexity?
- Performance overhead of cloning?

### Q5: Common Interceptor Patterns
**What interceptors have proven most valuable in production actor systems?**
- Distributed tracing integration patterns?
- Metrics collection best practices?
- Security/validation interceptor examples?

### Q6: Performance Benchmarks and Profiling
**What are the real-world performance characteristics of interceptor implementations?**
- Akka's message adapter overhead measurements?
- Orleans filter performance impact studies?
- Proto.Actor middleware benchmarks?
- JavaScript-specific optimization techniques?

## 8. Additional Considerations

### Integration Points
- How will interceptors integrate with existing ask pattern?
- Should interceptors see/modify correlation IDs?
- How to handle interceptors for system messages?

### Testing Strategy
- How to test interceptor ordering?
- Performance regression testing approach?
- Mocking strategies for interceptor tests?

### Future Extensions
- Support for interceptor composition?
- Dynamic interceptor registration/removal?
- Interceptor state management?

## 9. Success Criteria
The research should help us:
1. Choose optimal interceptor hook points
2. Design a performant chain execution model
3. Establish clear error handling policies
4. Create a type-safe, ergonomic API
5. Avoid common pitfalls from other implementations

### Research Scope
- **YES to real-world benchmarks**: Include any available performance benchmarks or profiling results from Akka, Orleans, Proto.Actor, or other high-performance actor systems
- **YES to interface flexibility**: Open to changing the interceptor interface shape based on research findings. Consider:
  - Combining lifecycle hooks if it improves performance
  - Alternative patterns (e.g., single function with phase parameter)
  - Sync vs async trade-offs
  - Zero-cost abstractions for common cases

## 10. References to Explore
- Akka HTTP Routes and Directives (similar chain pattern)
- Express.js middleware implementation (for JS patterns)
- RxJS operators (for composition patterns)
- Envoy Proxy filter chain (for performance insights)
- AWS Lambda Layers (for interceptor composition)

### Benchmarking Resources
- Akka performance tuning guide (interceptor overhead)
- Orleans performance best practices
- Node.js performance optimization patterns
- V8 optimization killers to avoid

### Alternative Interface Patterns to Research
1. **Single function pattern**: `intercept(phase: 'before' | 'after', context: InterceptContext)`
2. **Pipeline pattern**: Similar to Express middleware with `next()` callback
3. **Aspect-oriented pattern**: Decorators or annotations
4. **Reactive streams pattern**: Operators that transform message flow
5. **Plugin architecture**: More comprehensive lifecycle hooks
