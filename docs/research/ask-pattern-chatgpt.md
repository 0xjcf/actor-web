Perfect. I’ll dive into how established actor systems like Akka, Erlang/OTP, and Orleans implement the ask pattern internally, and map out a strategy that fits your TypeScript + XState-based Actor-Web Framework. I’ll cover API design, correlation ID strategies, type-safe request/response handling, and integration with your existing RequestResponseManager and CLI flow. I’ll also highlight common pitfalls, performance implications, and alignment with your pure actor model principles.

I’ll get back to you with a detailed, actionable implementation strategy.


# Implementing the Ask Pattern in a Pure Actor Model (Actor-Web Framework)

## Ask Pattern in Mature Actor Frameworks (Akka, Orleans, Erlang/OTP)

**Akka (JVM):** Akka’s *ask* pattern (also known as *Send-And-Receive-Future*) allows an actor to send a message and get a Future/Promise for the reply. Under the hood, Akka creates a **temporary one-off actor** (often called a *PromiseActorRef*) for each ask request. This ephemeral actor is the *sender* of the request; when the target actor replies (using `sender() ! response`), the temporary actor intercepts the message and completes the corresponding promise. Akka uses this unique actor (and the fact that each actor processes one message at a time) to **correlate responses to the right request**, avoiding mix-ups even if multiple asks are in flight. A timeout is always applied to an ask operation to prevent resource leaks – if the reply doesn’t arrive in time, the Future is failed (and the temp actor usually stops). This is analogous to using a correlation ID internally, though the implementation is via the actor reference.

*Best Practices:* Akka’s documentation and community advise **using ask sparingly**. It has some overhead (creating an actor for each request) and can complicate failure handling and timeouts in complex request chains. Overusing ask (especially chaining multiple asks) can lead to performance issues – e.g., a pipeline of five sequential asks creates four extra actors and multiple timeouts, where a simple message forward or direct reply could be more efficient. Akka encourages the fire-and-forget (*tell*) style for most interactions, using *ask* only when a synchronous request/response is truly needed (often at system boundaries or for external clients). In practice, protocols can often be designed to send one request and have intermediate actors forward or route a final response back, rather than using ask at every step (Akka’s `forward` preserves the original sender for this purpose).

**Erlang/OTP:** Erlang’s actor model (via *gen\_server* in OTP) similarly provides a synchronous call mechanism. A call (`gen_server:call`) generates a unique *reference* (correlation ID) and sends a message to the target process with that reference and the caller’s PID. The gen\_server replies with a message containing the same reference, which the caller is waiting for. By default, OTP applies a **5 second timeout** to such calls. If the reply isn’t received in time, the call raises a timeout error (in OTP, the calling process will crash by default if unhandled). This pattern ensures one-to-one pairing of request and reply: the unique reference acts like a correlation ID. Because Erlang processes are lightweight and the VM is scheduler-driven, the caller can *block* waiting for the reply without freezing the system (the VM will schedule other processes) – a contrast to our Node/TS environment where blocking is not an option. OTP’s best practice is to use `call` for synchronous interactions when necessary, but design most interactions as asynchronous `cast` messages when possible to avoid unnecessary coupling and potential deadlocks. Notably, **circular ask deadlocks** can occur in any actor system: e.g., if Actor A asks B and B in turn asks A, both wait on each other. OTP’s solution is simply to time out in such scenarios (since each call times out and error/exit signals are raised). The general guidance is to avoid cyclic request patterns or make actors *reentrant* so they can handle other messages while waiting (Orleans and some actor frameworks offer reentrancy to mitigate this, discussed below).

**Orleans (Distributed .NET):** Orleans takes a different approach where *every* call to a grain (actor) is essentially an async request/response. Calling a grain method returns a `Task<T>` (promise) – this is Orleans’ built-in request-response mechanism. Orleans runtime automatically handles **location transparency** and correlation: the caller doesn’t know or care which server the grain lives on, the runtime routes the request to the correct silo, and when the grain method completes, a response message is sent back to fulfill the Task. Under the hood, Orleans messages include a **Correlation ID** and the runtime matches replies to the awaiting Task on the caller side. Timeouts are also applied (configurable in Orleans; default is generous, e.g., 30s) – if a grain doesn’t respond, the Task faults. Because Orleans ensures each grain processes one message at a time (unless marked reentrant), a scenario where two grains call each other simultaneously can lead to deadlock until timeouts occur. Orleans documentation explicitly calls out this pitfall: if Grain A waits on Grain B and vice versa, both calls can stall and eventually throw timeout exceptions. The recommended practice is to **avoid cycles** or enable *reentrancy* for those grain methods so they can interleave processing and prevent deadlock. In summary, Orleans’ “ask” is implicit in its API — every grain method is like an ask — and it relies on the framework to manage message routing, correlation, and timeouts transparently. This model aligns with location transparency: the code for calling a grain is the same whether it’s local or remote, and Orleans handles the serialization and message exchange behind the scenes.

**Summary:** All these frameworks implement ask/request-response with the same core concepts: a *unique identifier* per request (whether an actor reference, a UUID, or a unique tuple) and a mechanism to *complete a promise or waiting context* when the reply arrives. Timeouts are essential to avoid waiting indefinitely on lost messages or crashed actors. The ask pattern is powerful but should be used judiciously. **Tell (fire-and-forget) is the default** for actors to remain loosely coupled; ask introduces a form of temporal coupling (the sender must wait for a reply) and can impact scalability if overused. When implementing ask in our framework, we will mimic these best practices: use correlation IDs (as we already started with `RequestResponseManager`), enforce timeouts, and ensure that an actor handling a query sends a proper response without blocking its own processing.

## Designing the Ask API in TypeScript with XState

In our Actor-Web framework (TypeScript + XState), the ask pattern should provide a **type-safe, promise-based API** on top of the existing actor message system. The goal is to make it as ergonomic as Akka’s `ask` or Orleans’ async method call, while preserving the purely asynchronous, message-driven execution.

**Type-safe Request/Response Messaging:** We need to define the request and response *event types* such that an actor’s interface clearly pairs each request with an expected response. This often means introducing distinct message types for requests and responses. For example, our `GitActor` already defines events like `{ type: 'REQUEST_STATUS', requestId: string }` and a corresponding response event (perhaps `{ type: 'STATUS_RESPONSE', requestId: string, ...result }`). We should formalize this convention: an actor that can handle queries will accept a `{type: 'REQUEST_X', requestId, ...}` and will *emit* a `{type: 'RESPONSE_X', requestId, ...}`. In TypeScript, we can leverage **discriminated unions** or mapped types to link these together. One approach is to define an interface or type mapping, e.g. `interface GitActorRequests { REQUEST_STATUS: StatusRequestPayload; RESPONSE_STATUS: StatusResponsePayload; … }` so that the ask call can infer the response type from the request type. Our `ActorRef.ask<TQuery,TResponse>(query:TQuery)` signature can be defined such that `TQuery` is constrained to known request events and it yields a `Promise<TResponse>` of the corresponding response data. Utilizing TypeScript’s generics and conditional types can ensure that if, say, `query.type === 'REQUEST_STATUS'`, the Promise resolves with the type of the `'RESPONSE_STATUS'` event’s payload.

**Integration with XState:** XState state machines handle events and can produce side-effects (actions) and update context. To implement ask, we have a couple of options:

* *Use XState Actions for Response:* One pattern is to have the actor’s state machine, upon receiving a `REQUEST_X` event, immediately trigger an action that sends the corresponding `RESPONSE_X` event back to the sender (perhaps using XState’s `sendParent` or `sendTo` if we maintain sender reference). However, since our actor model is *pure message passing* and location-transparent, it might be better to treat the response as just another event that the actor emits. In our current design, the actor’s context stores an array of outgoing responses (`snapshot.context.responses`). The ActorRef’s infrastructure intercepts these and routes them to the waiting promise. This is a clever way to keep XState machines relatively unaware of the ask mechanism – the machine can simply output a response (e.g., as an action that appends to `context.responses`), and our framework will catch it and fulfill the promise.

* *RequestResponseManager:* The existing `RequestResponseManager` in our core already handles correlation IDs and promises. When `ActorRef.ask()` is called, we generate a **query envelope** with a unique ID and store a pending promise in the manager. The actor receives the query event (with an ID in its payload), processes it, and somewhere produces a response event with that same ID. The ActorRef’s subscription (set up via `setupMessageHandling()`) looks at every new snapshot; if it finds any outgoing `ResponseMessage` in the actor’s context, it passes it to the RequestResponseManager’s `handleResponse` function. `handleResponse` then matches the ID to the stored promise and resolves or rejects it accordingly.

To fully implement this, we should **expose the ask functionality through the public API** (ensuring the ActorRef interface and ActorSystem support it) and ensure all actors that can handle requests are structured to use it. On the XState side, we likely need to implement a standardized way for state machines to produce responses. This could be a *utility action* (e.g., `respond(requestId, result)` action factory) that developers can use in their machine definitions. For instance, when defining the `GitActor` machine, on receiving `REQUEST_STATUS` we could transition to some state or perform an action that calls `respond(requestId, { status: ... })`. The `respond` action would internally format a `ResponseEnvelope` object that our ActorRef can recognize and place into `context.responses`. We saw a TODO in `createQueryableActorRef` about integrating standard query handlers – likely the plan is to augment actor machines with a built-in way to handle queries and send back responses.

**Timeouts and Retries:** Our TypeScript implementation should allow specifying a timeout for asks (just like Akka’s implicit Timeout or OTP’s call timeout). In fact, our `ActorRef.ask` already uses a default of 5000ms in `createQuery(...)`. We should make this configurable per ask (via an options parameter) or via the ActorRef’s default options (the `ActorRefOptions.askTimeout` is defined in the interface but we need to wire it through). On timeout, the `RequestResponseManager` should reject the promise with a `TimeoutError`, and perhaps the actor could later discard any late response. Retries could be implemented by caller logic (the framework can simply provide the rejection reason, and higher-level code can decide to ask again or handle failure).

**Promise vs. Callback:** Exposing ask as returning a Promise is idiomatic in TypeScript and works well with `async/await`. We just have to ensure that awaiting a promise does not block the actor’s internal processing. In our model, it won’t – the promise is resolved by an external mechanism. The actor that sends an ask can continue executing other code (it’s not literally paused; only the calling *fiber* or function awaiting it will yield). This is similar to how Orleans allows asynchronous calls within grain methods: the grain can `await` another grain’s call without blocking the thread, but note that Orleans would then not process other messages in that grain until the await completes (unless marked reentrant). In our framework, an actor could potentially send an ask and have an *onResponse* transition in its state machine, but more commonly, we expect ask to be used by external callers (like CLI commands) rather than actors asking other actors internally (to avoid tight coupling).

**Typing Example:** We should strive for a design where if a developer does: `const result = await someActorRef.ask({ type: 'REQUEST_STATUS', payload: {...} });`, the `result` variable is inferred to the correct response type (say a `StatusInfo` object). Achieving this might involve generics on ActorRef that carry a mapping of request to response types. For instance, `ActorRef<TEvent, TResponse>` might be defined such that `TEvent` includes both normal events and query events, and `TResponse` represents *all possible response payloads*. In our code, ActorRef has a generic `TResponse` which is currently `unknown` or set when we create a query-able actor. We might refine that so each actor’s machine can declare what it returns for queries. This is a complex TypeScript typing exercise, but it’s feasible using conditional types or by having developers explicitly supply the request/response pair types when creating an actor. (If needed, we can provide an `Askable<TRequest, TResponse>` interface or similar to make the linkage explicit).

## Ensuring Location Transparency for Ask Operations

A core principle of Actor-Web is **location transparency** – actors can be anywhere (different threads, processes, or hosts) and communication is still via messaging. The ask pattern must uphold this. Concretely, an actor’s *ask* request to another actor should work the same whether the actors are in the same process or across a network boundary.

**Cross-Process Messaging:** If in the future we distribute Actor-Web actors across processes or servers, an ask call would likely be implemented with the same request ID and correlation mechanism, but the message has to travel over the network. This means the `query` message (with its unique ID) would be serialized and sent to the remote actor, and the remote actor’s response must be routed back. The correlation ID (or a composite like \[source actor ID + requestId]) must be unique across the distributed system. Frameworks like Orleans solve this by a **distributed directory** and message routing – when you call `actor.ask()`, the system knows the actor’s location or finds it, sends the message over, and when a response comes, it looks at the ID and knows which waiting promise to resolve. In Actor-Web, implementing this fully may be a future concern, but we should design the ask pattern such that it doesn’t *assume localness*. For example, our `RequestResponseManager` could be integrated with a transport layer: if an actor is remote, the manager might register the request and send the envelope via a network, and an incoming response message (from a remote actor) would call `handleResponse` as usual. The logic doesn’t really change – it’s all about ensuring the messaging layer can carry the correlation info end-to-end.

**Actor Migration or Restart:** Location transparency also implies an actor might move or restart (for resilience or load balancing) without callers needing to know. What happens to an in-flight ask if the target actor restarts mid-way? In such cases, the ask could fail or be retried. Orleans, for instance, can *transparently reactivate* a grain on another silo if one silo goes down, but any pending call that was in progress typically fails and the caller’s Task is faulted (unless Orleans has rerouted it, which usually it doesn’t mid-call). Our framework could handle this in a couple ways:

* If an actor crashes or is restarted while it has pending queries, those queries will likely time out. We should ensure that if an actor is stopped, we **cancel any pending requests** waiting on it. In our implementation, `ActorRef.stop()` already calls `requestManager.cleanup()` to reject all pending promises when an actor stops. This prevents memory leaks and gives immediate feedback to the askers that the actor is gone.
* On restart (if supervised to restart automatically), new asks would get new request IDs and proceed with the new actor instance. We might decide not to automatically retry the old asks on the new instance, because the state might have been wiped. Instead, it’s safer for the caller to catch the TimeoutError or ActorStopped error and decide to resend the query if appropriate. However, if we implement a higher-level *supervisor* or *router* that can redirect asks, that would be an advanced feature.

**Serializing Messages:** To maintain transparency, any data in the ask request or response must be serializable across the network. Using pure JSON-able objects for events (which we do by convention) is good. If we include functions or class instances, those wouldn’t work remotely. We should enforce that request and response types are simple data (or provide serialization methods). Orleans, for example, requires grain method parameters and return types to be serializable by its serializers.

**No Shared State:** With ask, it might be tempting to think “I can just call that actor and get some state”; but we must remember even though ask gives a synchronous-looking API (a promise), under the hood it’s still message passing. We are not breaking the actor model’s rule of no shared memory. The location transparency principle holds: the calling code doesn’t (and shouldn’t) know if it’s a local in-memory actor or a remote actor on another machine – the behavior and API are the same. Maintaining this illusion means we should design ask such that **nothing in the API reveals location**. For example, we wouldn’t want to give out direct object references or memory pointers; we stick to actor IDs and messages.

**Performance Consideration:** The user mentioned a target of 10,000+ asks/second. For distributed scenarios, that means our message routing and RequestResponseManager must be efficient. A potential bottleneck is the pending requests map – but a Map of 10k entries is fine in Node. The bigger cost is networking latency. Location transparency implies we accept that some asks might be slower if actors are far apart. In designs like Orleans, co-locating actors that chat frequently is a strategy to improve performance, but that’s a runtime concern. For our implementation, we just ensure the mechanism doesn’t *preclude* performance optimizations later (like maybe using a broker or direct actor links for replies in a cluster).

In summary, to honor location transparency, our ask pattern will use **the same messaging pathway as normal actor messages**. It won’t do anything that only works for in-memory calls. As long as the actor system’s messaging layer is location-transparent (which it is by design), adding correlation IDs and promises on top doesn’t break that. We must carefully handle actor lifecycle events (stop/restart) to not leave asks hanging. When an actor moves or is replaced, new asks will naturally route to the new location (if the ActorRef or ID remains the same and the system knows the new location). Any ask in flight during a move would likely fail unless we implement an advanced feature like *transparent message forwarding* during actor migration (which Orleans only recently added as “live grain migration”). That is beyond current scope; initially, a moving actor is effectively a stop+start, so pending asks drop (fail fast), which is acceptable under the fail-fast philosophy.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Request/Response Implementation

Implementing the ask pattern comes with several **pitfalls to avoid**:

* **Deadlocks Between Actors:** As noted, if two actors mutually wait on each other’s responses (cycle), they will deadlock. This can happen inadvertently if Actor A asks Actor B for something while simultaneously B asks A (or if there’s a cycle A -> B -> C -> A). Our framework should not attempt to automatically resolve such a deadlock – that’s a design issue. However, we *can* make it more visible. For example, timeouts will eventually surface the problem by rejecting the promises. In Orleans (non-reentrant mode), such a cycle will indeed cause both calls to time out. We should document this clearly: **avoid cyclical ask dependencies** or enable designs that break the cycle (like having one side do a tell and later get a response via a separate message, or marking certain actors reentrant if we ever support that). In our tests and supervision logic, we should consider detecting if an actor is waiting on a response from another actor that is waiting on it – though detecting that generally can be as hard as the halting problem. Simpler: encourage a request/reply to be one-way or use an orchestrator actor to collect responses from multiple actors rather than them asking each other.

* **Blocking the Event Loop / Actor Thread:** It’s crucial that no part of ask implementation blocks the JavaScript event loop or an actor’s execution thread. Our design using Promises and callbacks is naturally non-blocking – the actor sends a message and continues. The *caller* (which might be outside the actor system, e.g., a CLI command awaiting a result) will async-wait. That’s fine. Just ensure that within an actor, if it does an ask and uses `await` inside its own logic (say in a behavior implemented with async functions), it doesn’t inadvertently freeze that actor’s processing of other messages. In XState, states and transitions shouldn’t be long-running. If an actor state machine needs to call another actor, ideally it should send a request event and then transition to a state where it awaits a response event (this is a non-blocking wait, just a state waiting for an external trigger). We should avoid writing something like: `onEntry: async () => { const result = await someOtherActor.ask(...); /* then do something with result */ }` inside a machine, because while that async function awaits, the state machine might not handle other events. Instead, the pattern is to send the query and handle the response event in the state chart, keeping the actor responsive.

* **Resource Cleanup and Memory Leaks:** Each ask creates a pending entry in `RequestResponseManager.pendingRequests`. If an actor never responds, those entries could pile up. That’s why timeouts are essential: they ensure we remove the entry and reject the promise. We must also call `cleanup()` when an actor stops to clear any remaining pending promises. Forgetting to do so would leak memory and also possibly leave callers hanging indefinitely. Our implementation already accounts for this by hooking into `ActorRef.stop()` to cancel pending requests. Another edge case is if the actor does respond *after* a timeout (a late message). In Akka, the temp actor would be dead by then, so the reply goes to dead letters. In our case, if a response arrives after the promise is already rejected and removed, our `handleResponse` will find no pending entry and simply drop it. This is fine (the response is effectively ignored). We should ensure that an actor’s state machine doesn’t treat that late response as something erroneous; usually it won’t, because the response was meant to be consumed by the ask mechanism, not by the actor’s own logic.

* **Typed Error Handling:** When an ask fails (timeout or target actor crashes), our Promise should reject with an informative error (we have `TimeoutError` class for timeouts, and we might throw an `ActorStoppedError` if we try to ask a stopped actor). Callers should be prepared to handle these. We should test scenarios like: asking a permanently dead actor (should probably immediately reject with ActorStopped), or an actor that throws an exception while handling the query. If an actor crashes while processing a query, it likely won’t send a response. We might rely on the supervision system to restart it, but the current ask will time out. Alternatively, we could extend our protocol: an actor that fails could send an error response before dying. Akka’s ask, for example, if the target actor stops without replying, the future is completed with a `DeathPact` or an AskTimeoutException (depending on how it died). We might simulate that by detecting in `ActorRef` subscribe: if the actor stops and there are pending requests, maybe reject them immediately (so you don’t just wait until the timeout). This would improve responsiveness of error reporting.

* **Concurrency and Ordering Issues:** Since ask introduces an out-of-band promise resolution, we need to ensure that resolution of the promise doesn’t violate ordering guarantees. In actor systems, message ordering (per sender) is usually preserved. If we send messages A then B to an actor, we expect replies for A and B in that order (if the protocol is one reply per message). Our manager doesn’t enforce any ordering on resolution beyond what naturally happens. It’s possible an actor handles requests out of order (if it internally queues or processes differently), but usually they process in send order. It’s something to be mindful of but not a specific problem – just trust the actor’s processing order. We do need to consider thread safety: in a multithreaded environment, the `pendingRequests` map in RequestResponseManager should be thread-safe or confined. In JS, all this runs in one thread (unless we offload to worker threads in the future). If we did, we’d need locks or similar; but that’s beyond our current model.

* **Using Ask vs. Tell Appropriately:** One pitfall is using ask when a tell would suffice, leading to unnecessary waiting. For example, in our CLI, instead of doing `gitActor.send({type: 'CHECK_STATUS'})` followed by polling or waiting on state, we want to use ask properly. That is appropriate because the CLI truly needs the result to proceed. But *within* the actor system, if an actor just needs to inform another to do something, it should prefer tell. We should encourage designing actors such that they only ask when they need a result **now**. If the result can come later or be handled via an event, that might be better. Overuse of ask (especially in a chain) can reduce throughput significantly.

By anticipating these pitfalls, we can implement ask in a robust way: with **timeouts, proper cleanup, clear error signaling, and guidance to avoid circular asks**. In testing, we should simulate slow or unresponsive actors to see that timeouts free the promises, and simulate bursts of requests to ensure the system can handle many concurrent asks (10k/s will test the efficiency of our Map and event loop – likely fine, but we might consider pooling or faster ID generation if needed). We should also test that if an actor is stopped while asks are pending, the promises reject quickly (perhaps with a special error). This comprehensive approach will help avoid common gotchas like memory leaks or deadlocked requests.

## Placement of Ask Logic: ActorRef vs. ActorSystem Level

A design decision is whether the ask functionality should reside on the **ActorRef interface** (i.e., each actor reference has an `.ask()` method, as we have in tests) or be a separate facility on the ActorSystem (e.g., `ActorSystem.ask(actorRef, message)` or a static utility). Let’s consider both approaches and what other frameworks do:

* **ActorRef-level (Encapsulated):** Attaching `ask()` to the ActorRef makes it very convenient: if you have a reference to an actor, you can directly ask it. This is analogous to Akka’s approach in code (Akka Classic had a `?` operator via an implicit conversion on ActorRef; Akka Typed provides an `AskPattern` that still feels like calling a method on the actor). Orleans’ model is also effectively per-actor: calling a method on a grain reference returns a Task – you don’t call a central system to do it. The advantage of having it on ActorRef is that the ActorRef instance can carry any needed context (like the RequestResponseManager in our `ActorRefImpl`). Indeed, our `ActorRefImpl` already holds a `requestManager` and implements `ask()` using it. This means each actor has its own space for tracking pending requests and generating IDs, which is simple and avoids any global contention. It also fits naturally into our testing (we saw usage like `await actorRef.ask({ type: 'get', key: 'name' })` in tests).

  One consideration: if ActorRef is just an interface and we have different implementations (like local vs remote ActorRef), each should implement ask consistently. A remote ActorRef might implement `ask` by forwarding the request over the network and hooking into a remote response, but the caller code doesn’t need to change.

  Another benefit is **type context** – the ActorRef generic can carry information about the actor’s protocol, so ask on that ref can be type-aware. If we had a global ActorSystem.ask, we’d have to pass the actor identity and somehow the types.

* **ActorSystem-level (Central):** Some frameworks (notably Akka Classic *did not* put ask on ActorRef directly, because in untyped actors ActorRef had no dependency on futures; instead they provided a utility in `Patterns.ask(system, actorRef, message, timeout)`). An ActorSystem-level ask could in theory manage all asks in one place. For example, it could generate a unique correlation ID that’s unique across the whole system (instead of per actor). It could also manage a central map of pending promises. However, this has downsides: it becomes a single point of coordination and might complicate distributed scenarios (a central manager for an entire cluster doesn’t scale well). Also, it breaks encapsulation – now the ActorSystem needs to know about the internals of messages to match responses, etc., which is actually harder if messages can go between any two actors directly.

  Orleans doesn’t have a separate ask, but if we imagine, the Orleans runtime (which is akin to actor system) handles correlation centrally in the networking layer. In our case, the actor system could intercept all messages, but we’ve structured it such that the actorRef that initiates the ask handles the tracking. This is actually more modular: the asking actor’s ref and the replying actor’s ref cooperate via the requestId, without burdening the whole system with a global registry (except if we go multi-process, then we need some system-level help to route the response, but not necessarily to manage the promise).

* **Testing and Mocking:** Having ask on ActorRef makes it easier to stub or simulate in tests. For example, we could create a FakeActorRef for testing that implements ask by immediately returning a canned value (for unit tests of higher-level logic). If ask were only global, tests would have to spin up more framework components. Also, an ActorRef can be easily passed around to code that doesn’t need to know about ActorSystem, and that code can still perform asks.

* **Maintenance and Clarity:** By localizing the logic to ActorRef, we naturally tie the lifecycle of requests to that actor’s lifecycle. Our implementation already uses this to cleanup on actor stop. If it were system-wide, we’d have to listen to actor termination events to clear pending asks for that actor – doable, but extra book-keeping. Encapsulation in ActorRef is cleaner in this regard.

**Conclusion on placement:** It makes sense to proceed with the ActorRef-level implementation. This aligns with how we started (the `ask()` method in `ActorRefImpl`) and with established practices (e.g., an Orleans grain proxy or Akka’s implicit ask). We just need to ensure the ActorSystem (or ActorRegistry) can handle remote scenarios by delegating appropriately. Perhaps in a distributed setting, an ActorRef representing a remote actor will override `ask` to package the request and send it over the transport, then return a promise that will be resolved when a response comes back. But that is an extension of the same interface.

One thing to be careful about: if our ActorRef is a *unified* reference that might point to different underlying actor types (local XState machine, remote actor, or even a special test actor), we need a consistent ask behavior. We might consider implementing ask in the base ActorRef interface as a default that throws “not implemented” or uses a fallback, and have `LocalActorRef` implement it. However, since our `ActorRef` is interface + `ActorRefImpl` as the main impl, we can assume any “live” actor is using ActorRefImpl which has ask.

In summary, **implement ask at the ActorRef level**, backed by the per-actor RequestResponseManager, is the preferred approach. It keeps the API simple (just call `actor.ask(...)`) and leverages the locality of tracking and cleanup. We will not implement a separate ActorSystem.ask, since it’s unnecessary given our architecture. ActorSystem’s role might simply be to help route messages (especially if remote), but not to manage individual requests.

## Recommended Implementation Strategy for Actor-Web

Bringing it all together, here’s how we can implement the ask pattern in the Actor-Web framework in a robust, type-safe way:

* **Augment ActorRef and ActorSystem:** Ensure that the `ActorRef` interface and its primary implementation include the `ask<TQuery, TResponse>(query: TQuery, options?: AskOptions)` method. Our existing `ActorRefImpl.ask` already sends the query and uses RequestResponseManager. We should double-check that it uses the ActorRef’s configured timeout (e.g., from `ActorRefOptions.askTimeout` if provided) instead of a hardcoded 5000ms. We can easily pass the timeout to `createQuery` or `createRequest`. We should also add guards: if the actor is not running or is stopped, throw an error (to avoid asking a dead actor and never getting a response).

* **Use RequestResponseManager for Correlation:** Continue leveraging `RequestResponseManager` to create a promise and correlation ID for each ask. The manager should be owned by the ActorRef (so one per actor reference). This ensures if an actor is killed or restarted, its pending requests are contained. Our implementation already covers promise creation, timeout scheduling, resolving on response, and cleanup. We might want to enhance it to log or track some metrics (like count of pending, for debugging performance).

* **Define a Clear Request/Response Protocol:** For each actor that should support ask, define its events such that for every query there is a corresponding response. For example, in `git-actor.ts` define something like:

  ```ts
  type GitActorEvent = 
    | { type: 'REQUEST_STATUS'; requestId: string } 
    | { type: 'RESPONSE_STATUS'; requestId: string; status: RepoStatus }
    | ...other events...
  ```

  The actor’s state machine (perhaps using XState) should on `REQUEST_STATUS` perform whatever actions (like running `git status`) and then **send a `RESPONSE_STATUS`**. This could be done by adding to context or using an action to notify the ActorRef. Since we have the `responses` array mechanism, one straightforward method is to use an XState action that mutates context to push a response. We could write a helper, e.g., `actions.respond((context,event) => ({ type: 'RESPONSE_STATUS', requestId: event.requestId, status: computeStatus() }))`. That action would append the response object to `context.responses`. After the state machine step, our ActorRef subscriber sees `snapshot.context.responses` and pulls out each response to handle. We should ensure to then clear those responses from the context (maybe the actor machine itself clears them or our ActorRef could clear them after handling to avoid reprocessing). Alternatively, we could design the state machine to not accumulate responses indefinitely; possibly treat them as transient.

* **Incorporate the Ask Pattern in CLI Workflows:** Replace the current CLI patterns (which use `send` + waiting for a state change + `getSnapshot()`) with direct asks. For example, instead of:

  ```ts
  gitActor.send({ type: 'CHECK_STATUS' });
  await waitForState(gitActor, 'statusChecked');
  const state = gitActor.getSnapshot();
  ```

  we can define `gitActor.ask({ type: 'REQUEST_STATUS' })` to get back a `status` result. Internally, the GitActor will handle REQUEST\_STATUS and emit RESPONSE\_STATUS. This will significantly simplify CLI command code and ensure it’s purely asynchronous without polling. We should verify that the GitActor (or relevant actor) indeed implements those request handlers. If not, part of our task is to add the missing logic in those actors. (The prompt mentioned that `pure-git-actor.ts` was incomplete and not using the infrastructure – we should align it with the new ask pattern.)

* **Handle Actor Responses and Errors:** Ensure that for each request type, the actor always eventually either responds or the ask times out. If an actor might fail to produce a response (e.g., an error occurs), we have a design choice: possibly send an error response. For instance, define `{ type: 'RESPONSE_STATUS', requestId, error: '…' }` in case of failure, and have the RequestResponseManager treat an error field as a rejection. Our current `handleResponse` will reject the promise if `response.error` is set. We should utilize that: if a GitActor fails to get status (say the git command fails), it could catch and emit a response with an `error` property. Then the ask promise would reject with that error. This is cleaner than just timing out or silent failure. It gives the caller a clear failure reason.

* **Testing the Ask Implementation:** We will write tests to cover:

  * Simple request/response flow (ask returns the expected data).
  * Timeout behavior (if actor doesn’t respond in time, promise rejects with TimeoutError).
  * Actor crash scenario (perhaps simulate by having the actor throw instead of respond, and ensure ask promise is rejected, either via immediate ActorStopped or via timeout if not caught).
  * High concurrency (fire many asks and ensure all resolve correctly and `pendingCount` in manager goes back to 0).
  * TypeScript type checks (maybe a compile-time test or examples to ensure ask infers correct type).

By following these steps, we align our implementation with proven practices from Akka, Orleans, and OTP while tailoring it to our TypeScript + XState environment. The resulting ask pattern will allow actors in the Actor-Web framework to communicate in a **request/reply style without breaking the actor model principles**: all interactions are still via messages, we maintain location transparency, and we avoid any use of shared memory or synchronous blocking. We also pave the way for future optimizations (like distributed messaging) because the fundamentals (correlation IDs, timeouts, message routing) are in place.

In conclusion, the ask pattern will enhance our framework by enabling **clean, asynchronous request/response interactions**. Developers will be able to write code that awaits actor replies (improving readability in scenarios like CLI commands or HTTP request handling), and under the hood, it will be handled with robust correlation management, just like in mature actor systems. This implementation will replace ad-hoc patterns in our codebase with a consistent, type-safe approach, moving us closer to a pure actor model where even commands and queries are messages, not direct state accesses. With careful attention to the details above, we can implement ask in Actor-Web in a way that is scalable, resilient, and easy to use for our team.

* Akka ask pattern internals – uses a temporary actor with a promise to correlate each request/response
* Akka best practices – ask has overhead (spawns actors) and should be used sparingly vs tell
* Erlang/OTP gen\_server call – uses unique reference and 5s default timeout for request/reply, crashing on timeout
* Orleans location transparency – grain calls are automatically routed and location-agnostic
* Orleans deadlock example – two actors calling each other can deadlock and time out without reentrancy
* Actor-Web RequestResponseManager – correlation ID generation, promise handling, and timeout rejection in our framework
