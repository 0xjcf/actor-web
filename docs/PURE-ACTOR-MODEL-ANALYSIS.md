# Pure Actor Model Architecture Analysis

## Current Violations and Issues

Our current implementation has several critical violations of the pure actor model that prevent true distributed, location-transparent actor communication:

### 1. **Singleton Actor Registry** 
```typescript
// ❌ VIOLATION: Singleton pattern only works in single process
class ActorRegistryService {
  private static instance: ActorRegistryService;
  private registry = new Map<string, AnyActorRef>();
  
  static getInstance(): ActorRegistryService {
    if (!ActorRegistryService.instance) {
      ActorRegistryService.instance = new ActorRegistryService();
    }
    return ActorRegistryService.instance;
  }
}
```

**Problem**: This singleton registry only works within a single process and cannot span across multiple nodes in a distributed system.

### 2. **Direct Function Calls Instead of Message Passing**
```typescript
// ❌ VIOLATION: Direct function calls break location transparency
export function lookupGitActor(actorId: string): GitActor | undefined { ... }
export function cleanupGitActor(actorId: string): void { ... }
export function subscribeToGitActor(actorId: string, callback: Function): void { ... }
```

**Problem**: These direct function calls require actors to be in the same process/memory space, violating the pure actor model principle that actors should only communicate via messages.

### 3. **Hard-coded Local Actor Paths**
```typescript
// ❌ VIOLATION: Hard-coded paths assume local execution
const actorPath = `actor://system/git/${actorId}`;
```

**Problem**: These paths don't include network location information and assume local execution.

### 4. **Local Event System**
```typescript
// ❌ VIOLATION: Local event system doesn't work across network
const eventObserver = subscribeToGitActor(gitActor.id, (event: GitEmittedEvent) => {
  // Local callback only works in same process
});
```

**Problem**: Event callbacks are local functions that cannot be serialized or executed across network boundaries.

### 5. **Tight Coupling Between CLI and Actors**
```typescript
// ❌ VIOLATION: CLI directly imports and instantiates actors
import { createGitActor, cleanupGitActor, subscribeToGitActor } from '../actors/git-actor.js';

const gitActor = createGitActor(repoRoot);
```

**Problem**: The CLI is tightly coupled to actor implementations and cannot work with remote actors.

## Pure Actor Model Requirements

Based on research of Orleans, Akka, and Erlang, a pure actor model should have:

### 1. **Location Transparency**
- Actors should be addressable regardless of physical location
- Actor references should work whether actor is local or remote
- One unified API for local and remote communication

### 2. **Message-Only Communication**
- All actor interactions must use asynchronous message passing
- No direct method calls between actors
- Messages must be serializable for network transmission

### 3. **Virtual Actor System**
- Actors exist logically, not physically
- Actors can be instantiated on-demand
- Actor lifecycle managed by runtime, not application

### 4. **Distributed Actor Directory**
- Replicated actor registry across cluster nodes
- Automatic actor discovery and routing
- Fault-tolerant actor location tracking

### 5. **Supervision Hierarchy**
- Actors supervise other actors for fault tolerance
- Failures are isolated and recoverable
- Supervision works across network boundaries

## Proposed Pure Actor Model Architecture

### 1. **Actor References (PIDs)**
```typescript
// ✅ SOLUTION: Location-transparent actor references
interface ActorPID {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly type: string;
  readonly node?: string; // Optional for local actors
  send(message: SerializableMessage): Promise<void>;
  ask<T>(message: SerializableMessage, timeout?: number): Promise<T>;
}
```

### 2. **Message-Based Communication**
```typescript
// ✅ SOLUTION: All communication via messages
interface ActorMessage {
  type: string;
  payload: unknown;
  sender?: ActorPID;
  correlationId?: string;
}

// Instead of direct calls, use messages:
// actor.send({ type: 'GIT_STATUS', payload: {} });
// const result = await actor.ask({ type: 'GIT_BRANCH', payload: {} });
```

### 3. **Distributed Actor System**
```typescript
// ✅ SOLUTION: Distributed actor system
interface ActorSystem {
  spawn<T>(behavior: ActorBehavior<T>, options?: SpawnOptions): Promise<ActorPID>;
  lookup(path: string): Promise<ActorPID | undefined>;
  stop(pid: ActorPID): Promise<void>;
  
  // Cluster operations
  join(nodes: string[]): Promise<void>;
  leave(): Promise<void>;
  getClusterState(): ClusterState;
}
```

### 4. **Serializable Messages**
```typescript
// ✅ SOLUTION: All messages must be serializable
interface SerializableMessage {
  type: string;
  payload: JsonValue; // Only JSON-serializable data
  timestamp: number;
  version: string;
}
```

### 5. **Actor Supervision**
```typescript
// ✅ SOLUTION: Supervision hierarchy
interface SupervisionStrategy {
  onFailure(error: Error, actor: ActorPID): SupervisionDirective;
}

enum SupervisionDirective {
  RESTART = 'restart',
  STOP = 'stop',
  ESCALATE = 'escalate',
  RESUME = 'resume'
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Actor System
1. Implement ActorPID for location-transparent references
2. Create message-based communication layer
3. Build distributed actor directory service
4. Add message serialization support

### Phase 2: Virtual Actor System
1. Implement on-demand actor instantiation
2. Create actor lifecycle management
3. Add automatic actor placement and load balancing
4. Implement actor state persistence

### Phase 3: Distributed Operations
1. Add cluster membership management
2. Implement distributed supervision hierarchy
3. Create network-aware actor routing
4. Add fault tolerance and recovery

### Phase 4: CLI Integration
1. Refactor CLI to use actor references only
2. Replace direct function calls with messages
3. Add distributed actor discovery
4. Implement remote actor monitoring

## Expected Benefits

1. **True Distribution**: Actors can run anywhere in the cluster
2. **Location Transparency**: Code works same way for local/remote actors
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Actors can recover from node failures
4. **Scalability**: Automatic load balancing and actor placement
5. **Simplicity**: Developers don't need to think about distribution

## Migration Strategy

1. **Incremental**: Keep existing APIs while adding new ones
2. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Components can adopt pure actor model over time
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for distributed behavior

This analysis provides the foundation for implementing a truly distributed, location-transparent actor system that follows pure actor model principles.
