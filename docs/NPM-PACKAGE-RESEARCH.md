# üì¶ Agent-Centric Workflow NPM Package Research

> **Research prompt for creating a distributable npm package from our agent-centric development workflow**

## üéØ Executive Summary

We've built a sophisticated **agent-centric development workflow** that solves fundamental problems in collaborative development:

- ‚úÖ **Zero branch conflicts** through Git worktrees
- ‚úÖ **Smart validation** (only validates changed files)
- ‚úÖ **Automated coordination** between multiple agents
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent guardrails** and safety systems
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready tooling** with comprehensive documentation

**Research Goal**: Package this system as a distributable npm tool that any development team can adopt, potentially using the **actor model pattern** for the package architecture itself.

## üî¨ Research Areas

### 1. üì¶ Package Architecture & Distribution

#### A. Package Structure Research
```
@agent-workflow/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/                     # Core workflow engine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli/                      # Command-line interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/                # Project templates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/                  # Extensibility system
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                     # Documentation
```

**Research Questions:**
- Should this be a **monorepo** with multiple packages (`@agent-workflow/core`, `@agent-workflow/cli`)?
- Or a **single package** with modular architecture?
- How do similar tools (Nx, Rush, Lerna) structure their packages?
- What's the optimal **dependency management** strategy?

#### B. CLI Framework Selection
**Research Options:**
- **Commander.js** - Most popular, mature
- **Yargs** - Feature-rich, complex scenarios
- **Oclif** - Heroku's framework, plugin system
- **CAC** - Lightweight, modern
- **Custom solution** - Full control

**Key Questions:**
- Which framework best supports **plugin architecture**?
- How to handle **configuration management** across projects?
- What's the best approach for **auto-completion** and help systems?

#### C. Installation & Setup Experience
**Research Focus:**
- **Global vs local installation** patterns
- **npx** support for one-time setup
- **Progressive enhancement** (works without global install)
- **Scaffolding experience** for new projects
- **Migration tools** for existing projects

### 2. üé≠ Actor Model Integration

#### A. Meta-Architecture: The Package as an Actor System
**Concept**: The package itself follows actor model principles:

```typescript
// Package actors
AgentCoordinator ‚Üê ‚Üí GitWorktreeManager
      ‚Üï                    ‚Üï
ValidationActor ‚Üê ‚Üí FileWatcherActor
      ‚Üï                    ‚Üï
ScriptExecutor  ‚Üê ‚Üí HealthMonitor
```

**Research Questions:**
- How can we use **message passing** for internal coordination?
- Should **validation**, **git operations**, and **file watching** be separate actors?
- Can we implement **supervision strategies** for error recovery?
- How to make the system **fault-tolerant** and **self-healing**?

#### B. Actor-Based Plugin System
**Vision**: Plugins as actors that can:
- Subscribe to workflow events
- Send commands to other actors
- Maintain isolated state
- Fail gracefully without affecting core system

**Research Areas:**
- **Event sourcing** for workflow history
- **Actor lifecycle management** for plugins
- **Message schemas** for inter-actor communication
- **Backpressure handling** for high-frequency events

#### C. Distributed Workflow Coordination
**Advanced Concept**: Agents running on different machines:
```
Developer Machine A (Agent A) ‚Üê‚Üí Shared State Actor ‚Üê‚Üí Developer Machine B (Agent B)
```

**Research Questions:**
- Can we use **WebRTC**, **WebSockets**, or **shared databases** for coordination?
- How to handle **network partitions** and **eventual consistency**?
- Is there value in **real-time collaboration** features?

### 3. üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

#### A. Core Workflow Engine
**Architecture Research:**
- **State machine** for workflow stages (setup ‚Üí work ‚Üí validate ‚Üí ship)
- **Event-driven** vs **polling-based** file watching
- **Configuration layering** (global ‚Üí project ‚Üí user ‚Üí runtime)
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

#### B. Git Integration Strategy
**Deep Research Needed:**
- **Git worktree management** across different Git versions
- **Conflict resolution** automation strategies
- **Branch protection** and **merge policies**
- **Integration with Git hooks** and **CI/CD systems**
- **Support for different Git workflows** (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, etc.)

#### C. Validation System Architecture
**Current Smart Validation** ‚Üí **Extensible Validation Actors**
```typescript
ValidationCoordinator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TypeScriptValidator (Actor)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ESLintValidator (Actor)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PrettierValidator (Actor)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CustomRuleValidator (Actor)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TestRunner (Actor)
```

**Research Focus:**
- **Plugin system** for different linters/validators
