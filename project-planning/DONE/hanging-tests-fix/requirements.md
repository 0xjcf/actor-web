# Project Requirements: Hanging Tests Fix

## Problem Statement

Integration tests in the actor-core-runtime package hang indefinitely, preventing any test execution from starting or completing. This critical bug blocks:

1. **Development Progress**: Cannot validate pure actor model migration
2. **Quality Assurance**: Cannot run test suite to verify functionality
3. **Task Completion**: Stuck on Task 3.1 (Test Migration to Pure Actor Model)
4. **Framework Reliability**: Tests should be deterministic and complete quickly

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Tests hang during system initialization, before actual test logic executes
- Actor system spawns 5+ system actors during startup (guardian, event broker, discovery service, system event, cluster event)
- Background processes likely keep Node.js event loop alive
- Even after fixing XState timeout actor cleanup, hanging persists

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Integration tests start and complete within 10 seconds
- [ ] **No Hanging**: Zero infinite hangs during test execution
- [ ] **Clean Shutdown**: Actor system shuts down completely, releasing all resources
- [ ] **Event Loop Cleanup**: No background processes keep Node.js event loop alive
- [ ] **Deterministic Tests**: Tests pass consistently without timing issues

### Secondary Success Criteria  
- [ ] **Debug Visibility**: Clear logging shows where hangs occur (if any)
- [ ] **Resource Management**: All XState actors properly cleaned up
- [ ] **System Actor Health**: Core system actors (guardian, event broker, etc.) work correctly
- [ ] **Performance**: Test startup time under 2 seconds
- [ ] **Memory Leaks**: No memory or resource leaks during test execution

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain pure actor model compliance (no setTimeout, no polling)
- Must work with XState v5 integration
- Cannot break existing functionality during fixes
- Must follow @FRAMEWORK-STANDARD guidelines
- Changes should be backward compatible with current API

### Framework Constraints
- Actor system initialization must remain functional
- Core system actors (guardian, event broker, discovery) must continue working
- XState timeout management must stay pure (no JavaScript timers)
- Must integrate with existing supervision and lifecycle patterns

### Timeline Constraints
- High priority: Blocks Task 3.1 completion
- Must resolve quickly to maintain development momentum
- Should complete within 2-3 days maximum

## Stakeholder Needs

### Test Authors
- **Need**: Reliable test execution without hangs
- **Benefit**: Can write and run integration tests confidently
- **Impact**: Eliminates frustration with timing-based failures

### Framework Maintainers  
- **Need**: Clean, debuggable actor system lifecycle
- **Benefit**: Can identify and fix resource leaks systematically
- **Impact**: Reduced support burden and technical debt

### Pure Actor Model Migration
- **Need**: Working test suite to validate migration
- **Benefit**: Can complete Task 3.1 and proceed to Task 3.2
- **Impact**: Unblocks critical milestone deliverable

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Need**: Fast, reliable test execution in automated builds
- **Benefit**: Consistent build results without timeouts
- **Impact**: Maintains development velocity and deployment confidence

## Constraints

### Investigation Scope
- Focus on system actor lifecycle and resource cleanup
- Examine XState actor management across all system components
- Check for unclosed promises, subscriptions, or event listeners
- Identify any remaining setTimeout/setInterval usage

### Fix Scope
- Must fix root cause, not just symptoms
- Should be comprehensive solution covering all hanging scenarios
- Must include proper cleanup in both success and error cases
- Should add safeguards to prevent future hangs

### Testing Scope
- Must verify fix works for minimal test cases
- Should validate with full integration test suite
- Must ensure no regression in functionality
- Should include timeout safeguards for future tests

## Non-Requirements

### Out of Scope for This Fix
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Not optimizing test speed beyond fixing hangs
- [ ] **New Features**: Not adding new actor system capabilities
- [ ] **API Changes**: Not changing public APIs unless absolutely necessary
- [ ] **XState Version Upgrade**: Not upgrading XState version
- [ ] **Test Framework Changes**: Not switching from Vitest to other frameworks

### Future Considerations (Not This Phase)
- Enhanced debugging and observability for actor lifecycle
- Performance monitoring for actor system resource usage
- Advanced timeout management strategies
- Distributed actor system testing patterns

## Validation Criteria

### Functional Tests
1. **Basic Test Execution**: `pnpm exec vitest run src/integration/debug-minimal.test.ts` completes in <10 seconds
2. **System Lifecycle**: Actor system starts and stops cleanly without hangs
3. **Resource Cleanup**: All XState actors stopped, no memory leaks
4. **Error Handling**: Tests fail gracefully without hanging on errors
5. **Multiple Runs**: Can run tests multiple times without hanging

### Integration Tests
1. **Full Test Suite**: All integration tests in `src/__tests__/` and `src/tests/` run successfully
2. **Ask Pattern**: Ask/response patterns work without timeouts
3. **System Actors**: Guardian, event broker, discovery service function correctly
4. **Supervision**: Actor supervision and restart work without hanging

### Quality Gates
- Zero infinite hangs during any test execution
- All tests complete within reasonable time (<30 seconds total)
- No background processes remain after test completion
- Clean Node.js process exit (event loop empty)
- Memory usage returns to baseline after tests

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk: System Actor Lifecycle
- **Risk**: Core system actors not shutting down properly
- **Impact**: Continues hanging even after other fixes
- **Mitigation**: Systematic audit of each system actor's lifecycle

### Medium Risk: XState Actor Management
- **Risk**: Still missing XState actor cleanup in some paths
- **Impact**: Event loop remains active
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive review of all XState actor creation/destruction

### Low Risk: Test Framework Integration
- **Risk**: Vitest or test setup causing hangs
- **Impact**: Framework-level issue
- **Mitigation**: Test with minimal Node.js script to isolate
