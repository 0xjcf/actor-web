# Project Requirements: TypeScript Immediate Type Validation Fix

## Problem Statement

**Current Issue**: Our TypeSafeActor implementation is not providing immediate TypeScript error detection at method call sites. When developers use invalid message types (e.g., `'GET_USE'` instead of `'GET_USER'`), TypeScript errors only appear later when accessing response properties, not at the `ask()` call site where the invalid type is specified.

**Root Cause**: TypeScript generic inference allows invalid types to be passed to constrained generics, with errors only surfacing when the generic type is resolved to `unknown` during property access.

**Impact**: 
- Poor developer experience - errors appear in wrong location
- Type safety violations are not caught early
- Debugging becomes more difficult as error location is misleading
- Framework's type safety goals are not achieved

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Immediate Error Detection**: Invalid message types show TypeScript errors at the exact call site (`actor.ask({ type: 'INVALID' })`)
- [ ] **Precise Error Messages**: TypeScript provides clear error messages indicating valid message types
- [ ] **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing valid usage continues to work without changes
- [ ] **IDE Integration**: IntelliSense shows only valid message types in autocomplete
- [ ] **Universal Application**: Solution works for any actor with any MessageMap

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for type validation edge cases
- [ ] Type safety compliance with zero tolerance for `any` types
- [ ] Regression prevention ensuring type safety doesn't degrade over time

## Constraints

### Technical Limitations
- **TypeScript Generic System**: Limited by TypeScript's generic inference behavior
- **Framework Compatibility**: Must work with existing actor system without breaking changes
- **Performance**: Type-only solution - no runtime overhead acceptable

### Timeline Constraints
- **High Priority**: Type safety is fundamental to framework integrity
- **Research Phase Required**: May need deep TypeScript language investigation

### Resource Constraints
- **TypeScript Expertise**: Requires advanced TypeScript knowledge
- **Framework Knowledge**: Must understand actor system internals

### Quality Constraints
- **Zero Tolerance Policy**: No `any` types or type casting allowed
- **Strict TypeScript Compliance**: Must work with strictest TypeScript settings
- **Framework Standards**: Must follow @FRAMEWORK-STANDARD.mdc principles

## Stakeholder Needs

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Framework Developers**: Need immediate, precise type error feedback
- **Framework Users**: Need IDE support and clear error messages when using invalid message types
- **Type Safety Standards**: Framework integrity depends on reliable type checking

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Code Reviewers**: Need confidence that type safety is enforced at compile time
- **Framework Maintainers**: Need solution that doesn't create maintenance burden

## Non-Requirements

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- **Runtime Validation**: This is a compile-time type safety issue only
- **Performance Optimizations**: No runtime performance impact expected
- **API Changes**: Cannot break existing valid usage patterns
- **Alternative Type Systems**: Must work within TypeScript's type system

### Future Considerations (Not This Project)
- Enhanced error messages with custom TypeScript transformers
- Integration with other development tools beyond TypeScript
- Runtime type validation as a separate concern

## Investigation Findings

### Current State Analysis
1. **Generic Inference Issue**: TypeScript allows `K` to be inferred as `'INVALID_TYPE'` even when `K extends keyof T`
2. **Delayed Validation**: Type constraints only enforced when generic is resolved to concrete type
3. **Working Minimal Case**: Direct interface declarations work correctly, issue is in implementation

### Key Discovery
- Minimal test case shows immediate validation DOES work with direct declarations
- Issue appears to be in our `asTypeSafeActor` implementation or intermediate type layers
- `type: string` from base types may be causing type widening

### Potential Solutions to Investigate
1. **Function Overloads**: Replace generics with explicit function overloads
2. **Conditional Types**: Use conditional types that resolve to `never` for invalid inputs
3. **Template Literal Types**: Leverage newer TypeScript features for stricter constraints
4. **Assertion Functions**: Custom type assertion functions for immediate validation

## Dependencies

### Requires Understanding Of
- TypeScript generic inference behavior
- Actor system MessageMap interface design
- Existing TypeSafeActor usage patterns
- Framework's type safety standards

### Blocks
- Universal type safety rollout across all actors
- Framework type safety documentation
- Developer onboarding materials
- CLI command type safety fixes (secondary impact)

## Research Questions

1. **Why does direct interface declaration work but our implementation doesn't?**
2. **Is TypeScript generic inference fundamentally limited for this use case?**
3. **What's the minimal change needed to achieve immediate validation?**
4. **How do other TypeScript frameworks solve similar problems?**
