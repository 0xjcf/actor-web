# Project Requirements: OTP-Style Actor Implementation

## Problem Statement

The Actor-Web Framework currently lacks a cohesive, ergonomic API that mirrors the proven patterns of Erlang/OTP. Developers face several pain points:

1. **Inconsistent APIs**: Components use different patterns than actors, creating cognitive overhead
2. **Boilerplate Heavy**: Requires two separate calls (`machine.send()` + `emit()`) for domain events
3. **Not OTP-Like**: Missing the elegant message-passing patterns that make Erlang productive
4. **Type Safety Gaps**: Risk of runtime errors due to insufficient compile-time validation
5. **Scalability Concerns**: Current patterns don't naturally extend to distributed scenarios

The framework needs to evolve toward true OTP-style patterns that are familiar to distributed systems developers while remaining approachable for web developers.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
- [ ] **OTP Counter Example Works**: The research counter example runs end-to-end with `createActor()`, `defineBehavior()`, and ask pattern
- [ ] **API Consistency**: Components and actors use the same `defineBehavior()` API pattern
- [ ] **50% Boilerplate Reduction**: Single return statement replaces `machine.send()` + `emit()` calls
- [ ] **Zero Type Casting**: No `any` types or type assertions in implementation
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work unchanged

### Secondary Success Criteria
- [ ] **Ask Pattern**: Request/response with correlation IDs and timeout handling
- [ ] **Location Transparency**: Actors work locally, in Web Workers, and across network
- [ ] **Message Plan DSL**: Declarative message routing for complex communication patterns
- [ ] **Supervision Integration**: Proper error handling through supervision hierarchy
- [ ] **Performance Targets**: ≥1000 component updates/sec, ≥10,000 messages/sec

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **All Tests Pass**: 100% test suite success including new OTP patterns
- [ ] **Zero Linter Issues**: Clean, maintainable codebase
- [ ] **Complete Documentation**: Working examples and migration guides
- [ ] **Memory Leak Free**: Proper resource cleanup and lifecycle management

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Pure Actor Model**: No shared state, no timeouts, no polling patterns
- **Type Safety**: Zero tolerance for `any` types, all unknown values must use type guards
- **Framework Standards**: Must comply with Actor-Web Framework standard rules
- **Browser Compatibility**: Must work in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Bundle Size**: Runtime additions must be ≤4KB gzipped

### Timeline Constraints
- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks for core OTP implementation
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks for advanced features and polish
- **Total**: 4 weeks to completion

### Resource Constraints
- **Single Developer**: Implementation by AI assistant
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing codebase must remain functional
- **Test Coverage**: All new code must have comprehensive tests

## Stakeholder Needs

### Web Component Developers
- **Need**: Unified API that works the same way for actors and components
- **Benefit**: Single learning curve, predictable patterns
- **Pain Point**: Currently need to learn two different APIs

### Distributed Systems Developers
- **Need**: Familiar OTP-style patterns (ask, tell, supervision)
- **Benefit**: Can apply existing Erlang/Elixir knowledge
- **Pain Point**: Current API doesn't match known distributed patterns

### Framework Users
- **Need**: Less boilerplate, better ergonomics
- **Benefit**: More productive, less error-prone development
- **Pain Point**: Current runtime fan-out requires verbose code

### Framework Maintainers
- **Need**: Clean, testable, maintainable codebase
- **Benefit**: Easier to extend and debug
- **Pain Point**: Scattered documentation and inconsistent patterns

## Non-Requirements

### Explicitly Excluded
- **Observable Patterns**: No RxJS-style observables or reactive streams
- **Polling/Timeouts**: No `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or busy-waiting
- **Framework Rewrites**: Not changing fundamental architecture
- **Performance Optimization**: Focus on correctness first, optimization later
- **Advanced OTP Features**: No hot code loading, distribution protocols, or clustering

### Future Considerations
- **WebSocket Transport**: Location transparency across network (future phase)
- **Service Worker Integration**: Offline-capable message processing
- **Developer Tools**: Browser extension for actor system debugging
- **Advanced Supervision**: Escalation strategies, circuit breakers

## Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- XState remains the state machine implementation
- TypeScript provides adequate type system capabilities
- IndexedDB sufficient for future persistence needs
- Web Workers available for location transparency

### Business Assumptions
- Pure actor model provides sufficient abstraction
- OTP patterns translate well to JavaScript/TypeScript
- Developer ergonomics improvement justifies implementation effort
- Existing user base accepts incremental API evolution

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **Guardian Actor**: Must be fully operational
- **Component Integration**: XState bridge must work
- **Type System**: Actor message types must be stable
- **Test Infrastructure**: Wallaby.js testing setup

### External Dependencies
- **XState**: For state machine management
- **TypeScript**: For compile-time type safety
- **Vitest**: For test execution
- **Biome**: For code formatting and linting

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **API Design**: Getting OTP patterns right for JavaScript developers
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring no breaking changes

### Medium Risk  
- **Performance**: Runtime overhead from additional abstraction layers
- **Complexity**: Message plan DSL might be too complex for simple use cases

### Low Risk
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides good foundation
- **Testing**: Existing test infrastructure is robust
