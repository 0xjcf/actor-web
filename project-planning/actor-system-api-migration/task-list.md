## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks
- **Task 2.2 (Actor System Update)**: Core framework changes affecting message processing
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental rollout, extensive regression testing
  - **Fallback**: Maintain current implementation as backup

- **Task 3.2 (Ask Pattern Testing)**: Critical validation of business message correlation
  - **Mitigation**: Use wallaby for runtime debugging, comprehensive correlation scenarios
  - **Success Criteria**: Zero timeouts, 100% business message correlation success rate

### Medium-Risk Tasks  
- **Task 2.1 (Plan Interpreter Review)**: Must integrate with existing correlation systems
  - **Mitigation**: Test with current correlation manager using business messages
  - **Validation**: Side-by-side comparison with working ask patterns

- **Task 4.1 (Runtime Test Suite)**: Comprehensive validation of pure actor model
  - **Mitigation**: Systematic testing of each MessagePlan type and correlation scenario
  - **Success Criteria**: All tests pass with business message correlation

## Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path**: Tasks 1.2 ‚Üí 1.3 ‚Üí 2.1 ‚Üí 2.2 ‚Üí 3.2 ‚Üí 4.1
- This path represents the core functionality implementation
- Any delays in critical path affect overall timeline
- Focus resources on critical path tasks first

**Parallel Work Opportunities**:
- Task 1.1 can be done in parallel with 1.2
- Documentation (5.1) can be started during testing phases
- Type cleanup (4.2) can parallel runtime validation (4.1)
