# Project Planning Documentation

This directory contains all project planning documentation following the **Requirements → Design → Task List** workflow.

## Workflow Overview

All new projects and major features follow this three-phase planning approach:

1. **Requirements** (`requirements.md`) - Define WHAT and WHY
2. **Design** (`design.md`) - Define HOW  
3. **Task List** (`task-list.md`) - Break down into actionable steps

## Current Projects

### OTP-Style Actor Implementation
**Status**: Ready for implementation  
**Location**: `project-planning/otp-actor-implementation/`

- ✅ Requirements defined and documented
- ✅ Architecture designed and documented  
- ✅ Tasks broken down with dependencies
- 🔄 Pending approvals before implementation begins

### Actor System API Migration
**Status**: In planning  
**Location**: `project-planning/actor-system-api-migration/`

- ✅ Requirements defined
- ✅ Design in progress
- ⏳ Task list pending

### Pure Actor Context Fix
**Status**: In planning  
**Location**: `project-planning/pure-actor-context-fix/`

- ✅ Requirements defined
- ⏳ Design pending
- ⏳ Task list pending

## Completed Projects

Completed projects are moved to the `DONE/` directory for reference:

### ✅ Hanging Tests Fix
**Status**: **COMPLETED** 🎉  
**Location**: `project-planning/DONE/hanging-tests-fix/`  
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-21

**Key Achievements**:
- 🎯 **Root Cause Fixed**: System actor initialization using incorrect patterns
- ✅ **Tests Now Pass**: `debug-minimal.test.ts` completes in 333ms (was hanging indefinitely)
- 🔧 **Framework Improved**: Updated to use proper `defineBehavior` patterns
- 📚 **Documentation Enhanced**: Added comprehensive hanging tests prevention guide
- 🛡️ **Type Safety**: Eliminated `any` types in system-critical code

## Workflow Enforcement

This process is enforced by `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` which ensures:

- Sequential execution (Requirements → Design → Task List → Implementation)
- Proper change management for scope modifications
- Consistent documentation standards
- Clear approval gates between phases

## Migration from Old System

The previous planning documents have been archived:
- `docs/AGENT-A-NEXT-ACTIONS.md` → `docs/archive/planning/`
- `docs/IMMEDIATE-ACTION-PLAN.md` → `docs/archive/planning/`

---

**Note**: Projects move to `DONE/` when implementation is complete and all acceptance criteria are met.
