# Project Planning Documentation

This directory contains all project planning documentation following the **Requirements â†’ Design â†’ Task List** workflow.

## Workflow Overview

All new projects and major features follow this three-phase planning approach:

1. **Requirements** (`requirements.md`) - Define WHAT and WHY
2. **Design** (`design.md`) - Define HOW  
3. **Task List** (`task-list.md`) - Break down into actionable steps

## Current Projects

### OTP-Style Actor Implementation
**Status**: Ready for implementation  
**Location**: `project-planning/otp-actor-implementation/`

- âœ… Requirements defined and documented
- âœ… Architecture designed and documented  
- âœ… Tasks broken down with dependencies
- ðŸ”„ Pending approvals before implementation begins

## Workflow Enforcement

This process is enforced by `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` which ensures:

- Sequential execution (Requirements â†’ Design â†’ Task List â†’ Implementation)
- Proper change management for scope modifications
- Consistent documentation standards
- Clear approval gates between phases

## Project Structure

```
project-planning/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                           # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ [project-name]/                     # Individual project directories
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.md                 # Requirements document
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ design.md                      # Design document
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ task-list.md                   # Implementation tasks
â””â”€â”€ templates/                         # Document templates (future)
```

## Migration from Old System

The previous planning documents have been archived:
- `docs/AGENT-A-NEXT-ACTIONS.md` â†’ `docs/archive/planning/`
- `docs/IMMEDIATE-ACTION-PLAN.md` â†’ `docs/archive/planning/`

This structured approach replaces the scattered documentation with a systematic, reviewable process.

## Getting Started

To create a new project planning set:

1. Create directory: `project-planning/[project-name]/`
2. Copy templates from workflow rule documentation
3. Fill out `requirements.md` completely
4. Get requirements approved
5. Fill out `design.md` completely  
6. Get design approved
7. Fill out `task-list.md` completely
8. Get task list approved
9. Begin implementation

## Benefits

- **Clear Understanding**: Each phase builds understanding before moving forward
- **Reduced Rework**: Catch issues in planning, not implementation
- **Better Estimates**: Detailed task breakdown improves time estimates
- **Traceable Decisions**: All architectural choices documented with rationale
- **Reviewable Process**: Each phase can be reviewed and approved separately
