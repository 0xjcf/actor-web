# Project Planning Documentation

This directory contains all project planning documentation following the **Requirements → Design → Task List** workflow.

## Workflow Overview

All new projects and major features follow this three-phase planning approach:

1. **Requirements** (`requirements.md`) - Define WHAT and WHY
2. **Design** (`design.md`) - Define HOW  
3. **Task List** (`task-list.md`) - Break down into actionable steps

## Current Projects

- 🛡️ **Type Safety**: Eliminated `any` types in system-critical code

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED COMPLETION ORDER**

### **PHASE 1: UNBLOCK DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW** ⚡
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Must complete first, blocks everything else

#### 1. **Agent Workflow CLI Fix** (2-3 days)
- **Status**: 70% complete, Phase 3 pending
- **Blocker**: **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW BLOCKED** - Team cannot use `pnpm aw:save/aw:ship`
- **Effort**: 2-3 days to refactor 8 commands to pure actor model
- **Risk**: HIGH - Every commit/push operation currently fails
- **Dependencies**: None - can start immediately
- **Outcome**: Daily development workflow restored

---

### **PHASE 2: QUICK WINS** 🚀
**Priority**: HIGH - High impact, low effort completions

#### 2. **Actor System API Migration** (2-3 days)
- **Status**: 80% complete, documentation pending
- **Why Next**: Enables OTP implementation, nearly complete
- **Effort**: 2-3 days for documentation and testing
- **Risk**: LOW - implementation already complete
- **Dependencies**: None - independent work
- **Outcome**: Actor system can handle MessagePlan responses

#### 3. **OTP-Style Actor Implementation** (1-2 days)
- **Status**: 90% complete, optimization pending
- **Why Next**: Quick completion, unlocks advanced actor patterns
- **Effort**: 1-2 days for performance optimization and edge cases
- **Risk**: LOW - core functionality already working
- **Dependencies**: ⚠️ **Requires #2** - needs MessagePlan handling in actor system
- **Outcome**: Mature actor system ready for production

## 📊 **EFFORT vs IMPACT ANALYSIS**

| Project | Effort | Impact | Completion | Blocks Others? | Order |
|---------|--------|--------|------------|----------------|-------|
| CLI Fix | 2-3 days | **CRITICAL** | 70% | ✅ **YES** (blocks workflow) | **1st** |

## ⚡ **EXECUTION TIMELINE**

### **Week 1: Unblock & Quick Wins** (Critical Path)
- **Days 1-3**: Complete Agent Workflow CLI Fix Phase 3 ⚡
- **Days 4-5**: Complete Actor System API Migration documentation 🚀

### **Week 2: Complete Infrastructure** 
- **Days 1-2**: Complete OTP Implementation optimization 🚀
- **Days 3-5**: Start Event Broker DX Improvement Phase 1 🔥

### **Week 3-4: Major Feature Development**
- **Days 1-10**: Complete Event Broker DX Improvement 🔥

### **Week 5: Framework Polish**
- **Days 1-4**: Implement Pure Actor Context Fix 📋

## 🔗 **DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS**

### **Confirmed Dependencies**
1. **CLI Fix → Everything** - Blocks development workflow, must be first
2. **API Migration → OTP Implementation** - OTP needs MessagePlan handling in actor system

### **No Dependencies Confirmed**
- **Event Broker DX**: Builds on existing Event Broker Actor (unchanged), purely additive API layer
- **Pure Actor Context Fix**: Interface cleanup only, doesn't affect functionality
- **API Migration ↔ Event Broker**: Event Broker uses existing messaging, no system changes needed
- **OTP ↔ Event Broker**: Both work with existing actor system, no conflicts

### **Parallel Work Opportunities**
After Week 1, **Event Broker DX** and **Pure Actor Context Fix** can be done in parallel with any other work since they have no dependencies.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

1. **Start with CLI Fix** - Everything else is lower priority until this is done
2. **API Migration before OTP** - OTP actors need MessagePlan response handling
3. **Event Broker is the biggest effort** - Allocate dedicated time, don't interrupt
4. **Context Fix is flexible** - Can be done anytime, good for filling gaps

## 🎯 **MILESTONE TARGETS**

- **End of Week 1**: Development workflow fully restored + API Migration complete
- **End of Week 2**: OTP implementation complete, Event Broker started  
- **End of Week 4**: All major features implemented
- **End of Week 5**: Framework fully polished and compliant

## Workflow Enforcement

This process is enforced by `.cursor/rules/workflow.mdc` which ensures:

- Sequential execution (Requirements → Design → Task List → Implementation)
- Proper change management for scope modifications
- Consistent documentation standards
- Clear approval gates between phases
