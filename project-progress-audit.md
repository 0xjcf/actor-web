Based on my analysis, the roadmap audit's assessment is largely accurate. Here's the current
  state:

  Current Project State vs Roadmap

  ✅ What the Audit Got Right

  1. Framework Progress: ~60% - The audit correctly identified that core actor features are
  partially done but key pieces like ask pattern and remote messaging are missing.
  2. CLI Migration: <10% - Still using direct function calls (askGitActor, lookupGitActor) which
  violates pure actor model.
  3. Virtual Actors Implemented - We have a sophisticated virtual actor system with Orleans-style
   activation/passivation, but it's not integrated with actual network transport.
  4. Advanced Features Built - Event sourcing, capability security, HTN planning, and hybrid
  memory are all implemented but feel premature given core gaps.

  🔴 Critical Gaps Confirmed

  1. Ask Pattern Broken - The .ask() method literally throws "not yet implemented"
  2. No Real Distribution - WebSocket/Worker transports don't exist
  3. Message Serialization Unused - We built serializers but they're not wired up
  4. Performance Unknown - No benchmarks to validate 10K msg/sec claim

  📊 Revised Status Assessment

  | Component              | Roadmap Says | Reality   | Action Needed                 |
  |------------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
  | Phase 0.5 (Pure Actor) | URGENT       | 40% done  | Fix ask(), remove singletons  |
  | Phase 1 (ActorRef API) | BLOCKED      | 60% done  | Not blocked, needs completion |
  | Phase 2 (Reactive)     | PLANNED      | 0%        | Correctly deprioritized       |
  | Phase 3 (Distributed)  | PLANNED      | 30% built | Transport layer missing       |
  | Virtual Actors         | Not explicit | 80% done  | Needs transport integration   |
  | CLI Migration          | 20%          | <10%      | Major refactor needed         |

  🎯 Recommended Immediate Actions

  1. Fix Core Basics First:
  // This must work before anything else:
  const response = await actor.ask({ type: 'QUERY' });
  2. Complete Message-Only Migration:
    - Remove askGitActor, lookupGitActor
    - Make CLI use actor.send/ask exclusively
  3. Implement ONE Transport:
    - Start with in-process transport
    - Then add WebSocket for true distribution
  4. Defer Advanced Features:
    - Move event sourcing, HTN planning, etc. to separate packages
    - Focus on core actor model

  📝 Updated Roadmap Recommendation

  The audit's suggested roadmap is good but needs one adjustment:

  Phase 1: Pure Actor Core (NOW)
  - ✅ Fix ask pattern implementation
  - ✅ Remove all direct function calls
  - ✅ Complete supervision (resume strategy already added!)
  - ✅ In-process message transport

  Phase 2: Distribution (NEXT)
  - WebSocket transport
  - Actor migration
  - Performance benchmarks

  Phase 3+: Everything Else
  - Keep as proposed in audit

  The framework has impressive advanced features but needs to go back and finish the fundamentals
   before it can claim to be a true actor system.
