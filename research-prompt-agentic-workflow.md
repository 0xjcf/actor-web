# Research Prompt: Agentic Workflow Implementation

## Executive Summary
Building on our existing Actor-Web framework and Agent-Workflow CLI, we need to research how to evolve from "smart automation" to "true agentic workflow" with memory, planning, and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Foundation
Our project already has strong foundations:
- **Actor-Web**: ActorRef system, bounded mailboxes, XState integration, 10K+ msg/sec performance
- **Agent-Workflow CLI**: Smart validation, Git worktree management, agent-aware operations
- **Architecture**: Message-passing actors, supervision strategies, observable patterns
- **Performance**: Optimized for developer workflows (10x faster validation)

The research focuses on bridging from this solid foundation to autonomous agentic behavior.
